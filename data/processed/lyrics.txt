atop the news this evening
thanks, bob.  due to extreme technology advancements, i'm able to report to you live here, from what military officials are calling a 'hot zone.' as you can see and hear, i'm right in the middle of the battlefield. our pentagon regulations asked us that we are, uhh, to stay towards the, uhh, back of the unit. but let me see if i can bring us a little closer so you can see exactly what's going on
900 cc's of the raw in one fist
order in the court where the mortars jump bricks
everybody, lung on the table, this point/counterpoint
aesop has the murkiest, yet he numb out the prowler oint
and after bubblegummy sink into the sofa
clicker the pilot his broadcasted choice of cobra
the venom remains the same game of stale toxins
camo'd with the now ornamental satellite options
whatever's good i got this grave half dug
with yanni coverin 'cats' to make the pain worse than it was
playin marbles
death is sweet
damien probably wishin i'd donate a fuck
this shit's chiller than any conversation i've had in months
the iron fang drew 'em all loopy
so when he extended a hand the planets plutos went snoopy
and perfect syncopated burnt to crispy critters
like synchronized swimmers in boric rivers
lick chopped chicken, who dares lick a shot at pigeons?
why i oughta
he surfs city circuits for the power and the glory
to the cowards in the quarry, you will always blink before me
its doc roc full effect, campfire stories
like i threw ya mama from the train for tryin to front on 'porkies'
he finds the garbage more inspiring than the good stuff
his ink sleeps while the military look tough
look, im sorry, crooked priority list
but mr. usa up all night's blackened heart already skips
i'm 'bout to crash this bitch to hibernate
tell wolf blitzer holler at his boy when he hosts blind date
it goes spit on cnn and force the war back thru the cable box
gremlins are like stage props aimed at latest names dropped
so now we ignorant, right?
no  we just accepts the inevitable apocalyptic syllabus
sing along, zook-a-dize chemical poison, then watch him bring it on
i dead opinions and swap it out for the urges
of a serpent tryin to stuff it in the jam before the curtains
he's numb to the guns  thanks to the tank cam
glued to the box like the opposites'll shake hands
enough hell for the world's hand baskets
enough cell's for the world's hand captured
numb to the guns  now he touch buttons that'll re-route imagery
yes doggie, recognize the misery
switch for element of surprise and demise
from m-16's to disco in hula-hoops
murder the fads before the fads murder you and yours
me and mine find t&a; on tnt
pleasing to the iris more than tnt on dna
morbid but important  i know, stop
mork porked mindy in this episode, watch
p-o-w-b buzz over the rumbling cannons and lest amateurs, bystander analyst
went thru the 'holy fuckin' shit, i'm gonna die' phase
now it's 'well, i'm gonna die, lets get this barn's sides raised'
so when they ask 'whats your opinion on the war?'
i tell 'em 'war sucks donkey dick. what's the knicks' score?'
maybe it's his allergies to horns and pitchforks
dusk muskrat
elegant bloodbath leggin it, egg 'em on
television preg-a-nant and medicine is born
get a mean doubt community duel glazed over blank, white sockets
lookin for a heavy seven richter to shiver the crocs right up out they options
novacaine, bloodwork spooned thru the loch ness
hostage, no shame, suck the fear out his muck
so when the nozzles hit his nostrils
after all, its just like on t.v. around the clock
the thorns are real the anger management is not
he's numb to the guns  thanks to the tank cam
glued to the box like the opposites'll shake hands
enough hell for the world's hand baskets
enough cells for the world's hand captured
numb to the guns  now he touch buttons that'll re-route imagery
switch for element of surprise and demise
it's like that yea we don't watch, uhh, we don't watch the war, we watch fuckin fuckin bikini car wash shit's more amusing to me these days sorry if that makes me an asshole
yo, i?ll send this to alla my corporate corpses
trying to abort the thoughts, coming out wilin?
i was surely sort of twisted
worked at a tv studio, an audio assistant
easy, do my duty, though at times was in a ?me? mood
i was on the brink of fiends truth
made a brother the same color but beyond neon
barking at dreams to be gone
???talent and many they haven?t any
as he?s cuffing it, how my mic sound?
thinking on the low, it?s perfect when he put the mic down
clown stand steady, willing wanting subservient
sound man blurting in thinking i?d fucking murder them
gotta win as these cats be modelin? what not to do
storms on the harbor, like a harbinger of bore
gore?s my harbinger, pardon the art of war
get your door?s darkened by the house of card carpenters
who never thought a slave could be a spartacus or
pencil sharpener with a resume for the carnivores
a bunch of these punch numbers
five punch just say no to company functions
and i duck into the dungeons
like a day of pinching paperclips and staplers for the privilege
two lives, one is chores for whores
one is where i wanna be when you begin regretting yours
and i?m boredom with a large coffee
to a man who authority beyond what it was for
how you gonna pay the rent?
make rap records matter fact thanks!
aesop- pain cave uno, smoking a broken blue note. tar pit escape artist carcass linger in the bull doze. rose radio lazarus via linear bark screaming 'i'm back to kill the video star and i'm double parked!'

chiba- she pissed champagne and shit caviar. don't the watch the stars, the stars ain't fallin' any sight of glimmer  lo. shimmering king, spring, they're trembling.
aesop- o.k. the web spread from brooklynites to born-in-barn kittens who's gimpy half step hid behind noah's arc systems. inconspicuously clustered with the boas, sharks, and pigeons like zoo york won't clock them rusted crutches up mopping the ship deck. texas hold'em pocket ace investment. totem altimeter tiki torch it. freak abort. fold or hold a cold cell in peak enforcement fortress. that's a sheep corpse who under penumbra turned tail like a sea horse.

chiba- first they line up, we'll divide them. suede get roscoe, then design 'em. aesop rock box drop the hot rod getaway car, and head up the rock highway.
i spit with an immense amount of power
skull flame showers, cowards, cower, underneath our
storm clouds that indicate the acid rain hours
now or, never, ever, ending on a bad note
ripping a crab's throat for spitting a bad quote
i smash black folk and white folk alike for jokes with mics
and make a kodak moment out of the most boring open mic
i'll make a sad fan appreciate rap again
fuck around and forget just how wack it's been
i'm a bad man
i catch bullets in my molars, body slam boas
and take flight with the weight of the world on my shoulders
and play david blaine on any chains that hold us
what started out as food for thought, turned into thoughts to turn they
crews into food in hopes to satisfy my
insatiable appetite to dine on lifeforms
you solar system is my condiment
i'm bombin' comets, and don't sweat the small things and nonsense
every dog has his day and even more so in rhyming
so i decided that i'd never play the fire hydren
or grab the mic sounding lazy, worn down and tired
cats don't really fall off they just get uninspired
but before you, get a reason to ever diss us
i'll drop a ill lp and disappear like bobby fischer
but this is, the building block of all that is
and what it is, is alchemy
alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder
alchemy, we made this to take your style under
metal frame, walking through a, metal game with a limp, tight grip
determined not to let time slip
this is alchemy, iron b-boy and all his glory
alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story
metal frame, walking through a, metal game with a limp, tight grip
determined not to let time slip
birded murders with a burn gurshin a peasantry
nervous flux flirtin' with hurley burly chemistry
graffiti burner urchin merchant with a certain urge jerkin' served and centerpiece
my zig-zag bully balance gallops with a fiery outline
ban and bomb y'all pastel poets belly up
born stylin' 4 dimensions count em'
3 to take to ya muck one to build a world you'll never touch
and i'm a pilot, delerium, serum, poison arrangement
?aroused? when i feel like storming suck the raw enslavement
with a grin-style stinger creeping out the basement
impatient wild ritualistic visions of sacrificial bitch cadence
for all my iron giant soldiers with a metal fist upshielding mother nature
from her fatal wrist cuts story i'll respect you
yeah i had em' up all night praying i'd re-release music for earthworms
greed even are lease screaming with milestone like ring ring ring i just
caught the scream phoenix click dial tone
welcome to a clouds swell blew to hallucination war pillar
i dash like a jack rabbit that orbits revelation with a single pounce
to edward scissorhands your string of doubts
this is that mighty case of home field advantage to bend your blizzard with
a crocodile smile and five robot knuckles to your kisser
this is alchemy, basic with a touch of wild wonder
alchemy, we made this to take your style under
metal frame, walking through a, metal game with a limp, tight grip
determined not to let time slip
this is alchemy, iron b-boy and all his glory
alchemy, hold it from the colder sob story
metal frame, walking through a, metal game with a limp, tight grip

up jumps the boogie delivering eye jammies
walk through the muck with a clutch on a trident
never give a fuck how far pi went
you are dealing with a reborn icicle age poltergeist
uprock, sidewalk cycles stuck at the bus stop
wired underagers play box cutter facelift
to y'all i'm just a funny moniker with a couple of fresh records
and a bangin' hand style to put the jukies on the guest list
out the homes of starving children
and i bet they can see the city bleeding from the satellites
formed by the corporate war drums recorded poorly
bruised by the hues of wicked pallets
chewed by the tooth of livid maggots
dino dna and cola, straight no chaser
cause cips with a z bargain
cute the way your little parasol spins.
and all they heard's crews gulp in bulk and sulk in volts
suicidal eye full of plastic nine.
they only came to buff the name stuck the train
for my seed up in flames
curators cater to killers of innovators
choke train buffers like a headlocked ed koch
nurture the craft of concrete visionaries
cave painters screaming "loosen the cuffs!"
cave paintings get the natural history feather dust
limo tint stretch delorian chrome sittin on twenties
then i walk to the stouge, burning my laundry
fucked up jeans back at the party spinning kane meets flight of the valkryies in a heartbeat.
saber tooth, catalog, city art, liturgy
ranger ricks endanger the clique maximum efficiency
the line of blind winged pygars and how they wallow planks into the matmos.
binder bibles and a graphite prison violator
with joshua for the war gamer systems.
now the architects are rioting cause we built something different
i'm like how the fuck sure shot evolution not my business?
grape soda, grape ape, great space coaster,
dnd, gi joe, transformer, herculiod, thundercat, voltron, speed racer, space ghoster.
kiss the flickering images with carroll ann fingertips,
they say his eyes were spiraling back when he hit the mat
"oh it's like that?"
started bendin spoons and rippin arrows outa lady hawks
with a c3p unit tryin to interpret the baby talk
right turn woulda missed the iceberg, fine.
but you don't like our kind. do you?
junkyard dog. hot tin roofs cradle kittens with them sub par flaws.
rappin is my radio, graffiti is my tv.
they only came to buff the name stuck the train
for my seed up in flames
curators cater to killers of innovators

don't get cooked by the pilot light
i can smell metal in the air tonight
i can smell metal in the air tonight
i can smell metal in the air tonight
don't get cooked by the pilot light
i can smell metal in the air tonight
i can smell metal in the air tonight
i can smell metal in the air tonight
and it is with the dogs with their rifles, thousands of them line the pavement, like patients pupae waiting to become worms
the people are dead, but the money keeps talking
another dark night, teethin the market of b-sheep, like i'm walking around the 39 thieves in a beat spores of a warm helvetica brown proper for the odd gutter monster propped on the teleprompter, wild blue yonder blue in the face angel blew into the bugle in lieu of the euthanasia, usually the shooter community chew the corpse but i see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours, day of the dead play the ledge closely train the barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey, dope, the gonzo have always felt choked socially, stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies earth lies divided by fighting tribes all we do is watch em waddle back and forth lighting fires  detonator wire cutters pliers two cities and one is broken up in tiny tiles and i walk, pose, harmin the heart of the lion's throat for a photographic children of my primordial growth, you parade around a kill so damn proud like a flat-line fetish had his feathers fanned out, war totem symmetry, skip into it gingerly, silk worms ping pong minister to ministry, hells bells every which way the winds blows, so i bang my head against any wall you can build, go
another dark night, another not alright, another bad ritual, war-bot surgery, better follow the bread-crumbs back, in fact, urgently, there's water through the session where the natives feel murder-y, vicinity wandered claim no zone never let an anchor drop never had a home never talk to strangers never trust a friend, this is the life and the life will not end
next time think, 39 thieves, quicker than 40 winks, raise your drinks, 39 thieves, quicker than 40 winks
why are you consumed with the community aloofness, dude we're animals we'll just go where the most food is, lower the toast most former letter-kid is useless, truth is you're equally expendable as spoon-fed, , money is cool i'm only human but they use it as a tool to make the workers feel excluded, like the shinier the jewel the more exclusive the troop is, bullets don't talk bribes stupid, they shoot shit
another dark night, down it goes, tread around the rabbit hole, weapons to the heavens and arsenic where the carrots grow, piss warm suger water where the summer canteen plus burn rubber like green is the new green, rubber neck froze, slows by the multiplex, rodeo commotion i'm open to see what culminates, bourgie on the right, left rep rebel force, both say the futile "prove the parking lot was never yours," black top pebble bores, soldiers molded when the joneses every grown-up in dakota came to groping, no motives they showed em the gross quotas, hog barn burner come see if your home told us, 85 rattle trap park the fancy, he could swear he was steppin outta comanche, antsy, let us in he jettison the medicine and paranormal hatchery condense and break the levees in , we both know the totem camaraderie, tokin' up equality, they posted horizontally, pride of golden load the doctor brought a lobster colony, half-mass slags have caps through em properly, and sleep the sleep of the just, ready on the left when the witchcraft spun it with a neighboring sect, with the usual undesirables and the big brother cutters, on the day your name became "this motherfucker?!"
another dark night, another not alright, another bad ritual, war-bot surgery, better follow the bread-crumbs back, in fact, urgently, there's water through the session where the natives feel murder-y, vicinity wanders claim no zone never let an anchor drop never had a home never talk to strangers never trust a friend, this is the life and the life will not end
the people are dead but the money keeps talking
well any asshole with a book of matches can light a fire fresh
make that sucker burn for days, i'll be impressed
circlin past the culture's bigot, procreation baked in advanceable
then ball and scurry up the grass to roll his marbles off the anthill
i know gerth and nature but recognize absentee ballot
and sappy ballads couldn't fill the void
this game's in the giant tugboat complex and he's annoyed!
i'll find my own bullies to shake a finger wrapped in
realigned mine knives in divine justice
plus this uncontrollable laugh with those ample waves of brain finally crash
brimstone clone with legs and dim poems
things cooperate like paper dog participants litigans
picket well or ride or burner style clinic
p-h imbalance to burn the malice martyrs spaceless
i want to be the halo that jumps off the brain
of the genius who decided some pictures deserved frames
yeah i call him god, he calls me jesus
when i lost my religion, he fell to pieces
i keep my ghoul spirit concealed
until the warriors return to the coney isle wonder wheel
my momma told me there'd be days like this
days like this, days like this, days like this
okay, tell me who you chill with and i'll tell you who you are
i walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar
it's a modern sensation on the boulevard of maintenance
to sweep your broken hopes under the rugs then hug the playpen
this revolution pushing through the loose pins and a strait jacket
a maverick classed in a bunk category
they had him parallel with a tattered glory division
it's like, nine o'clock wake  spit obscentities
my girl ties on my cape, smoke a bone then work my dental tree
the clear day's laced with a classic mother nature thunderchaser set
that got my papergrain's wings wet
voyeurist amendments lack expansive coverage in the syllabus
i dance with shuckles while you man the keyhole grilling code
i've done my chores according to god's schedule
with coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals
metal edge kings that tends to rapel the pebble
i live to autograph the iron curtain with doveback feather pens
spurting magma, cursing television urns to burn until my cleopatra
minor  dispersed slap on the wrist
for the tennants lacking the arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship
i'ma call home until the rock meets the angels
yoput one up shackle me, not clean logic procreation
i did not invent the wheel i was the crooked spoke adjacent
while the triple sixers lassos keep angels roped in the basement
i walk the block with a halo and a stick poking your patience
ya'll catch a 30 second flash visual
dirty cooperative neptune blue head hurt splits
ridiculous fathom the splicing of first generation
fuck up or trickle down anti hero smack
i paste the game to zero all completion green
took an early retirement pick a dream
i'll hold the door open so you can stumble in
and you would stop following me around the jungle gym
now it's an honor and i spell it with the 'h' i stole from heritage
marry crutch stolen wretched refuge refuse my teaming resonance
i promise temperance storm breed with a leaning conscious
in a credence relax responsive with my sports outsource the wattage
and i'm sleeping now  and the settlers laugh
you won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
you won't be laughing when the buses drag your brother's flags into rags
you won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs
and i hang my boots to rest when i'm impressed
so i triple knot them then i forgot them
but man those wings will never leave the ground
without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down
all i ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way
all i ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way
all i ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way
all i ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way
slacker bounded imitated tabloid headlined with the post
shimmy cross the centerfold, and a dead time in ghosts
giving crumbs for the better souls with seven deadly sins
to hear the plane to crystal conscious
to results a low life counting on one hand what he's accomplished
ok, lift me to activism chain activate street sweep
plug in deteriorating zenith pen dragging
i hack swords wars for the morbid spreading of mad men
sitting there licking log cabin in charlie chaplin waddle
i could zig zag and zig 'em again for the bad dreams
sparking my brick wall windows another thicket storm
and if one night in gotham without the wretched
dispatch a task of infested patch of city goblins
who split how many freaks with box cuts of a high road bellow
heads ripped! watch red bricks turn yellow
sort of similar to most backbones at camp icarus
raw feelings start congregating at pamper for bickering
life's not a bitch life is a beautiful woman
your only call her a bitch because she won't let you get that pussy
maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess
kiss the speaker wire or either pass it for some pagan thresh hold
wings span cast black of porn visuals hear the duck hunt ticker tape
vision and pick apart the pixels
i got a friend of polar nature and it's all peace
when i seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
this cat is asking if i've seen his little lost passion
"yeah, but only when i pedaled past him"
all i ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way
all i ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way
all i ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way
all i ever wanted was to pick apart the day,
put the pieces back together my way
ok, this is the dawning of the book of bitter aspects
where the jackals sit and watch the pedagogues last flesh
poison functions accompanied by six armorclad
tugged a portion of my severed vision
the gathering of loose ends in a bucket
every man's got a field to plow
but it's like, man i really can't afford the oxen
i smell the warm blood of the bill collector knockin
i get awkwardly sturdy with a frigid liquid backbone
i get swept in the pressure cooker tryin to paddle back home
i get sprung with a vibe and alliance of clean intention
by eclipsing doom midigons hatched to bash these picket fences
now i'll attend the wedding of the open sore and festering
now when the groom presents the ring
treasure, loose cannons span the starboard bow of
the clippership dipped in truth famine pressure
swallow brutal futility with a teaspoon full of sugar
i rock ready aim fire, while y'all rock ready fire aim
then blame the stationary target while the prey escapes the frame
merit badge marksman, or poacher, it's all the same
so i lay across the woods perpendicular to the grain
i wanna be a big bang, gotta be
never bottle me up in a probably, i wanna see a "yes sir, sir"
armed with a tone, cross, sword to the bone
warn the other brothers that was born forlorn
big bang, shovel in a big dig
huddled in a tunnel of big dreams i think big things
i'ma burn with this little light of mind
and a prime concern to earn thanks, i'ma be a big bang
i'm just a survivor of the wooly mammoth population
bottle neck effect, sorta born deaf
if you gon' metamorph the basemetal to precious
might as well steal from the rich, bewitch the peseants
i'm floating the hoaming pigeon out hell's kitchen window
left an sos infested bottle nestled in his grip so
with a prayer circle release party and hardy wild bellow
i observed him fly ten feet then dropped the bottles to the devils
fertile circle turn fertile crescent via bad investment
despised every second, but i guess i learned my lesson!
if i made an angel in the snow for every rotted victim
there'd be wings to float this mothership up out the godless system
well, i promise you i'll man the lighthouse
just to help guide in your ship
if you promise to help pull this hook out my lip
to circle suns via folklore pollutants derived strictly
from a bc generation disgust
life matter, i was us up all night with a rusty hammer
trying to build a fence around these magic beans my dreams are gathered
but uh, that certain lack of avail
i sail a choppy lie with bouancy like a bucket of rocks
it's gettin bigger by the second
ok, i'm here to rock the tugboat and bid the others farewell
i shook the buddy system wisdom till the similairs repel
i sell a barrel of spirit to dummy dimwits syndicate jackals
i'm broken arrow to the fuckin bone
i don't really believe in god
but god, i'm scared to death of god?!?
i swear to god, i never meant to spill the beans
it's like i hike an acre unimpressed
and slept on the sabre's edge
enough times to splice anti-christ's favorite pledge
and still my shepherd can't administer the proper push and pulls
i push the ghouls to man overboard
pull the bulls onto my sword
and buckle down in a corner chair of the round table floor
got an angel on my left shoulder, a devil on the polar
got a mug a frigid, got a mug a solar, sliiidde over
the recipe's design unplug the appetite for continuity
by stitching together an esteemed congruance
i peel back hearts and lodge grief physics in the chambers
cuartarize the wound and heads like "gimme gimme something major"
enveloped in a mummy ribbon system
hazardous portion organically nourished couraged to flourish and muses often
caution we proclaim until brain's off like sagittarius
shield. yield to the eye mescaline killer veals
stonegates marching moodily until plural styles immaculated beautifully.
sing rumble blue conglomerates sucking up lung while brushing parasitic critics to my left side.
i test glide kamikaze crashed to thoughtless on my preface.
now slow-mo quasimotos teeter on ringleader status while i spit satellite photos while teetering on the stratus.
sleepwalking the atlas after none. trudge and nudge my ninety-nine octane brain to one-oh-one.
run to organize my mood like quarterize my wound and climb up.
lovely samaritans line up like bar codes for a fraction of my factions.
the hollow of his hand beholds contraptions via
amplified files collapsed in cacophonic conquest. my specs up.
more postille and docile insubordinance your phylum.
for a dotta asylum swarmed your coordinates. rush.
i'll tourniquet your turbulence then trample on your stutters.
if i could displace every vagrant in america with traces of my character the earth would be a more pitiful habitat.
with infinite acres of auto-cry eight can aid ya. swung open the nomenclature to obscure wool-lock trickery. pure
has not got tossed back by liquors supporting patience, working knuckles for audio duplication.
that's like fiending for a purpose.
jabberwocky rocking on the highest hilltop.
i possess two siamese styles that's like connected at the mic hollering monstrous.
swept off your meridian. it's operation start with a slummy raped your milk and honey.
can i like, conjure up like all potent components of like,
middle siblings scribbling on his lonesome like,
hit him with my ninety-nine metal plated mics upon the wall, take them down, pass them round, rock them all. bust it.
i'm forever building my city of lost children ripping rungs off your ladder at a
sardonic smirk. ebonics lurking where the crop circles got stamped out from the rain dance.
tsunami rain blast tipped off like origami frames and sloppy braincasted class-a-piece mastered to capture your flag then flutter.
while slaves defy water, start roofing paper bags.
the magic-maker dragging devils to add triple sixes melted triple glitches on your console.
i calibrate my mics prior to claim and shit is rockable.
unlock and pull a backdoor for the bounce.
while cannily panicking was the average. i broadcast modern boredom mesozoic poetry pupils.
caught up in scruples from the inimical nature of my program.
elegant, the overcast password cursed on a tactless bastard, catatonic until personal practice mastered.
on a sunny afternoon in lower east side new york
good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder
and good evening wonderful riddance and such
maybe today i'll touch the burgundy halo
trimming the tunnels and of in with tenants
spangled cross a more tangible premise
?? it needs splinters all up in day-tripper visuals
take it easy man, fuck it i'll take it any way i can
when i witness fury scurry past my window
model city in a bottle plugged hostile
and a billion suckers pucker in a bind
maybe the sunken ship is the treasure
no, but they insist it man
i try to spin me dizzy spongin
as opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions
everybody pop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical
marveling at the spite with which it curdled
outside my tenement grows a little warmth
from out the mugs of masons wasted
laying bricks for days to later find they owned the lot adjacent
mark the blasphemy elements of elogance and savagery
murder the gossip, fuck it run off happily
the broken spoke cyclers chokin open doctors they as born fetus
in a matchbox conveniently padlocked to the hammer base
now these impurities embedded in five illiterates textiles
shedded in the hell tale to motivate blind suspended leverage
now i'm drowning in a pool of why are you here
sabotage with my beats the burden pertainance of if i die this year
my name's a thousand steps from patience
but i'm sick and tired of waiting
my name is every imperfection that plays a part in my descension
my name is delicate approach from symettricating my fellowship
my name is contaminate the rich
and clock the profits for the captain's sake
let us hope that the horrors of evil
no longer loiter on the doorstep of your past
circle of sandbags drag the shield a meal the meaty hand grabs
i'm splitting hopes at your local acropolis
opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a ??
sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address
exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine
unlatch the catch then cover up his trackers line
that will make his majesty furious
oh bury his head and how could i have been so dense
if only, yeah but i'm lonely
my days graze normalcy then morbidly crash
my years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh
alas, i dig my toes in to the sand and spit foliage out my lips personifying mankind's end all aspirations
no, hope sinks like broken boats and most harassed before provoked
i'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked
and when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance
i'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence
well i am a room with poison oak scaling the sides
arachnids on the celing, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes
if you can squeeze between the bars
in case the hand dealt by a stolen grace
do you ever wish the circle wasn't square
so when landsharks start circling the borders
you could just cut them off at the corners
there's a ghost in the basket of values
pertinent to, which cayak pilot succeeded in serving him proof
so if you need me spread your wings to spell my name
above the mess near the other funny requests
see bow to tolerant mannerisms of higher to win
to assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb skins
a child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise
supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested
violent humble shoes ten shades of blues come off the difference
i grimace, took me one hours blink to conclude that sickly innocence
my name's a thousand steps from patience
but i'm sick and tired of waitin
my name is every imperfection that plays a part in my descension
my name is delicate approach from symettricating my fellowship
my name is contaminate the rich
and clock the profits for the captain's sake
pad the circles 'round your life
to capture all the sides you sight
the ice is thin, stay off the lake
waiting for a clock to punch
wish i could breathe and stop for lunch
if i stop to count the leaves on only one of these here trees
not sure that i know what's pure
some respect, some resent, some remain from start to end
wear my heart on my short sleeves
i'm stuck out here, i lost my keys
from the roof i watch the street
and pray for those that's caught beneath
as long as i know right from wrong
i'll be ok, i'll sing my songs
i dunno what i have to left
to give other than truth and breath
angel when she shuts her eyes
like we will leave to my demise
about to start my last resort
wake me up when it's time to make babies
as long as i know right from wrong, i'll be ok i'll sing my songs
i've never felt pressure to have to justify my selfishness
at least not to your and yours
maybe just my friends and fellowships
as long as the mood is somehow linked to my enhanced development
there's a storm outside my tenament
beats upon my windows with mother nature's adrenaline
i guess that's why my homey blockhead stays glued to the television
'cause i'm the one that tried to bear the elements and lost
well it's warm by the filament
huddled up close in the company of all my relatives
stories lash like coffee and honest-to-god sentiment
cucooned inside the unified efforts to all get settled in
away from where the rain pours
weed out the bums who practice migration under the elegant
of course i realize to fill the ring, procedure's delicate
but lead devils inside to collide with your overzealousness
the urge could burst to turn even those hazardous to militant
you can't even have half of free second
you gotta aim, fire and the spider be model veteran
i'm stuck in the center and could care less
about the eye of the storm and its monstrous measurements
i got a defense that i call coolin' with my brethren
but it's better than risking life and limb to me, don't you agree?
if you wanna push, than i'm ready to push
but if you pulling while i'm pushing
then why did you ask me to push?
who's that walking with a whole in his head?
big bad bazooka tooth, i came to break bread.
what's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
i tell 'em fast cars, danger, fire and knives.
fast cars, danger, fire and knives
i got her majesty athena riding shotty wide-eyed
i pull the elephant tranq out of my neck, gaffle a tank, count up the chips, wrestle the fangs off of my fist, flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres on some holiday in cambodia with moter home appraisers. pagans fade into the kodochrome now, later with a lid to brow staple revist the cobra landing zone. molar foaming but he hold his own wound coderized by the zippo he had stole that afternoon. and my dog tags jingle by the moster island heart he built. grew up with a jughead crown tild and tardy slip. be all you can be just never soothed us. you lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush. holler scum's lullaby. live from the ultra-fly sham city bunker where the coldest cults multiply alarmingly. hush little baby, timeout. the black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick but lean to peck your eyes out of commission with love, out a tradition of wraiths pick on the visions that buzz, bet on the kitten's escape, solder the piston to pump out a veteran amplifier. and magnify through the samelens that set the ants on fire. flush the muppet hootenanny. who could fancy honor circuit when the circle's every duke is clammy? trooper, scoop the food in pantry. anti up, stupid. may delusion feed 'em foofi candy and pry the gold out of his when lamping. pocket all you can now. block will lead the lambs down to the cold cutlery outfit. slaughter beef and cow tip. pour the chief somefountain soda, motor prone to pen the holy opus and pry this monkey off the scoliosis.

kill every motherfucker but me. you cool with that? cool. bang. you? cool. hang. you? no? uh  bang? cool. sorry, dog, rules is rules. and too long have i followed yours. i'm trying to get them years back, and walk through every cipher with dynamite in a beer hat.
- krs sample
pull the pin out, sheep creep in wolf garb
fronted by the hail mary parry lunge mixer
kill the populace for stability, jeopardy's a stickler
its bob and weave amalgam played the falcon to your fixture
i branch out, arms flailing backwards
wailin upon a tidy sound circuit
with a bed of nails and drumlust plus disgusted service
workin in shifts opposite the asbestos brain furnace
i be the now observatory eye ear antenna feeler
spittin like a dragon with a similar demeanor
stood innocent bystand witness the diehard fans turn rip van
in the poppy fields of n.y.'s orchestrated brick gauntlet
now i'm thinkin who am i jabberwocky superfly bent left
pushin war without the ten step cushion and what
i plan to hold this beat positive sacred in these golde veins
until the day i die from grimace overload
this still be a getaway, let's display the sequence it goes:
one for the heartless thievery turning my guardian angel harpless
and the rest to sweep the mess under the carpet
i drag a yellow taxi meter behind every measure
and charge cats for labeling me shepherd
that'll be six fifty plus tip darlin,
i take cash, credit, check, money-order, gold and cigarette cartons
huh, got caught up in the universe tryin to zoom in on stardom
forgot the passion plus the hatred, both were based in carbon
next time you want to be a hero try saving somethin other than hip-hop
and maybe hip-hop'll save you from the pit-stop
(naw man it wasn't me it was holden caulfield brother
i just read and pulled the trigger)
oh god, well leave me to tiptoe past the pearly gates
capture the halo, jet back to base, step past the chase
the bad taste of jet-lag and weight slackers

purging formulas lookin for an improper cause is whack

promise me you gon shut the fuck up and recognize
what you holdin ain't really broken?
i don't flick neeedles like my sick friend
i don't march like beetle bailey through a quick trend
i don't frequent church's steeples on my weekend
and i don't comment if you formulate a weak zen.
all i ever really wanted was a getaway
i'ma take a chance by letting a brook slide for what i got in my hands
i can not agree to follow a leader while on the borderline
a war without a reason for the brady hates gore
bring out your dead we can put em in a pile
and burn em with the novels for the kids then to admire
kill the ones that speak from a different life
brewin other killer noise makin the sentiment
okay, welcome to the kamikaze bottle rocket cockpit
live by the icy cold hand of bad intention youth blender
oh yeah i'll let god warm the bench for now but
i'll ascend to spin y'all dizzy
yo, let the commoners speak publicly
then disperse eye jammies for cats that swear by third pupil
but can't see past the loophole
motherfucker, my word is born like siamese triplets
with doctor, lawyer, rocket scientist promise
hey mom, i'ma fix without my probe along this path
once my shpeel's perfected i'ma save you a seat in the front row
of aesop rock's twelve steps to shut the fuck up seminar
and when all these bickering crowds turn solid you gon be proud
i tack hacks to the
raw caricature of mayhem standard branded by the labor
with a thousand reasons to end this for every one of you saviors
saw the brightest burst ironically wide from the vacant stage
gave it a pound for burning where bunk ratio's engaged
keep me posted as to when you grasp something mature to
sit and sulk about mister, and i'll consider pickin up your record
the authors, they ain't got nothin to save

i was sitting on my fire escape and i saw
sturdy bridges, decorated with dirty pigeons
a vagabond begging for three pennies and a princess
a junkie tourniquet surgeon urging the needle in
a batty senior citizen flashing that awful teethless grin
i saw a corner store merchant rest on a milk crate with a stog'
a pierced nose, a model with a stalker, cheap hooker, jay walkers
a table on a sidewalk with four old men slappin' dominos down
a city, a village, a neighborhood, a ghost town
i saw vandals catching tags and puerto rican flags
i saw a pregnant woman on the verge of bursting
i saw a blind man with a dog screaming "someday i'll see it all"
and then he sat down with his hammer and saw
business men with multi-colored ties, cashmere checks
a nazi with tattoos on his neck, a vietnam war vet
a caucasian man with a limp and a cane, a pimp with his names
a thug circus, a pack of shook tourists hugging their purses
i saw freaks with rainbow streaks in dayglo hair
a mother smackin' the grin off her child, replaced it with a stare
a pothole, a storefront with a broken open sign
a hole in the wall bar kicking drunks to the gutter, it's closing time
i see a fuck up, a bum knuckle up with a taxi driver
a squatter, a grandfather, an angry right-to-lifer
i can see the roof garden on the apartment across the street
and kick myself because somewhere along the way i lost my seeds
i see a rat, a roach, a bat approach, a happy student
a black man with a horn and a will to make you sit and listen to it
i see a little girl on the corner with bubbles, braids and barrettes
i see a teen mother with similak pacifier and regrets
oh, a day turned stale, a hammer with a rusty nail, a failed marriage
a universe of brick buildings slightly off balance
a challenge, i see a chance to add real colors to my favorite palette
raise my mighty mallet towards the gods and swing my talons
i see a crack in the sidewalk
a slide show of six civilians gripping bottles of gideon
there's a fun house ooh, a sun spout
spraying yellow beams above yellow back dreams
a bus stop of commuters waiting to have their souls towed off to work
i seen the slap dash habits of bike messengers paws
and hug that good leaf on the way to damaged packages, dependence
oh my lord, i see bandwagons, all aboard
a carnival amusement park where a heart is a luxury
i see a gas galaxy huddled behind those pearly doors
maybe i should sit up on my fire escape a little more
stanton isle, up state, tri state
{just for my people} x 4
fresh cut as a pigeon blooded smoke
stoke the cobra coats over a broken hookah
got rabble pants with psycho dance and cook because the wattage
electric yoke n.y. there's guna be movie sluts in gospels
finish the bodega rode in moment composure to echo
my 23's lean over a cobra motor milligram bender
a tip lives prior to clipin the camaraderie
when metal maggot's borough in promised land vein division i tug my friend down to my astigmatism
packs and rows, max a golden butcher
last catapult standin in a land of coke and hookers
king cotton common, no problem for brick shawl lows, sock puppets and sitcoms describe long pages bread in a hotbox wigwam
debra tone hit the dish where the teens demonstrate ease in the hot days when she purchase the foundations of the last remix of ???? service
me oh i checked into the murals to see sub numinous fucker and um respect
find out what it means to me new york
walk knots with electric ninjas who bark bounce with punked out whip
like my company delorean's the shit
skipper's out of happy pills again, he's in the neighbors garbage
he's making paper dolls decorated with targets
he's labeling the dolls with the names of shitty rap artist
then tearing out the still beating heart from the loose-leaf carpets
i ordered a hovercraft off the back page of an rc comic
built it in three days and thought about starky comics
my gills call the east river rock bottom home in three eyed guppies and sea horses mutations
see new york as ancient rome, basic
my friend jumped of the empire state building while i hung 10th grade head cases
some of them lost the base hit
while they all read brims in the metal die cast voltron cadence, what
n.y. electric, cannibal, burners, pigs, magnums, crack, bag baby, roach bait
pristine kicks spread in the iris of the needle
i'm a thread the needle  4x
beaker 1-9-9-11-0-1 witness, maybe you don't get this
i was on a serious tree bender with my hands up but as she raised wall's show
never circuit bacon don't police me anymore
you're a trained professional ??? 41 shots over par
raise truth like charlie within a grants raise roofs in a glass wankavator
operate wild by the company of the turnstones and thinner
talk his way out of a sunburn and be home in time for dinner
paid dues since the door two days of bad acid and quaaludes
while a boom box talks trash to the richter
with a zip lock on a pill hole
i'll spend my last dollar on me
put one up for my family - should have made time to thank them
put one up for my crew - for recognizing the sanctum
put one up for the socially broke choke stoke me
new york pissed hits bleed dolby homie
n.y. electric, cannibal, burners, pigs, magnums, crack, bag baby, roach bait
pristine kicks spread in the iris of the needle
i'm a thread the needle  4x
beaker 1-9-9-11-0-1 witness, maybe you don't get this
where buildings fall and hopes crash
yeah, i'm vast air from can nox
you've been all over the world
you've hunted just about every kind of game
you've stalked elephant, lions, tigers, polar bears, dear
you've been within 15, 20 yards the most deadly game in the world
you've been with some of the most famous guides and hunters in the world
what's the biggest thrill you've ever had out of all of that?
well i think i can answer that best by calling attention to the
i saw the rod-eye cross and murder circle above my turret
slither spiraling banister down a hide
my ruby glass glazed specs staple to trade the market thieves
where vendors cop the stolen citrus out they pyramids
merry without a slapstick mavericks plugged directly to 3rd rail surges
piss on electric mayhem through city commuter circuits
oooh child, raises oddity, son of a circus side show freak
pertinent to the slide show, the wino's leak but i won't speak
infected projection hung thicken the air
punching is burning plastics upon whiffing the nasal cringes
pucker another 60-second lapse while 60 stars collapse the suckers
and i'm reborn every time the wine metamorphs back to water, my god
sweet christ crucify me with rail road spikes
use my skull to bash them all in, gather sit and grin, weave
all fair the most serene communication's pageant
where sitting with a stranger and living awards the badges
i spell marry with my name stitched on my heritage
incinerate arrogant simpletons to feed my cherished wind
buried in leagues a please, thank you, pardon, excuse me
your welcome, may i? ohh, i'd like to nod but no you may not
let's take a deep breath, naw let's take a breath
naw let's take, naw let's aaah shit, well i guess that about says it
maybe i'll craft the sycamore canoe and paddle upstream
where the luck seems to reflect precious lovely interventions
i have died a thousand deaths, and i apologize for you and yours
i mean i'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
and if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
i have died a thousand deaths, and i apologize for them and theirs
for breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
i mean i'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
and if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
you ever died a thousand deaths? i have
and in the morrow stood a thousand steps from where my nourish laughed
and made a boat at, nomad, i roam in a social coma
jones and behome alone days sink how my poems i
dig in the dirt i bring up the earth like pulley systems
thereby painting the perfect metaphor for hung juries
strung along a song of spawning thorns of fury
numb the anti-add-alarm before he recognized this worries me
carpet by my spearheading fink-eye beretta
walk my line, now what? now strut that little poison combine
y'all call natural, in honesty promise me twenty thousand salami links
and dive and finding my thriving ivy leaves climbing up the pit fall
lack of most lords aboard, heroes unsung heroes unbrung rewards
yo if i flutter in a trouble clutch then i dance fancy forward
like park children double dutching ropes in burning city summers
my wing span can and will employ full expansion
unfolding while lamping at home with my hands spanning for gold
told them the roof was on fire, when that structure burned to ashes
all y'all saw was aesop rock holding an empty book of matches
maybe i'll sit until the spilling motors clear
maybe i'll sit and stroke my billie goat beard
and rethink the time angels appear, maybe i won't
bundled in my humble little plummet
numb enough to die those thousand deaths under the sun it makes me sick
i have died a thousand deaths, and i apologize for you and yours
i mean i'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
and if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
i have died a thousand deaths, and i apologize for them and theirs
for breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
i mean i'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
and if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
i have died a thousand deaths, and i apologize for you and yours
i mean i'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
and if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
i have died a thousand deaths, and i apologize for them and theirs
for breaking down their ropes, ladders and stairs
i mean i'm only one servant, ayo one hell of a diversion
and if the masses have agreed to split the sea then let it bleed
the harvest appeared less plentiful than last season
i imagine sloppy seed handling avoke the stroke of tardy planting
and the crops we'd have harnessed in mid november
it only brushed the blossom bracket then soon sacrificed
lives to icicle jackets when the frosted
i sunk to find the walk beneath the mosses
where the planted tunnel pass after the rains have run their courses
but alas the portraits of these frosted corpses tortured in the grass
off of distorts or pour the one tall glass and nauseous
and i'm asking you, why's this spy supply hiding in strangers
when they know atop the food chains i could spot biters for acres
now be gracious, these minstools turn a bully's psycho civil
by dissolving the candy coated image down to the pixels
yelp bringing the self-stop freedom brigade investors
and the studies connecting one hit wonders with dust collectors
puts it down, and it's down beneath your sappy sing alongs
so stick it further down where the daunted decide which ring i'm on
nova yell just took positions and advance march
parts playing a scheme parking the rain in my canteen now i'm like
point i guess i could spare a splash for a couple of heads
counterpoint during my famine i never got broke your bread
well equation of intrigue, yes, yes, let me fed sit for a bit
these 'tensils need soaking before i hand out token
"shut the fuck up" drama like kabuki with a heart of dirt
skull fucked cross bones hence my birth it hurts
trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
i milk my habitat for almost everything i want
sometimes i take it all and still can't feel this pitfall in my gut
and i'm like must not sleep must warn others
trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
i'm trying to walk on top of sunshine
but it's ridiculous at times that's why i tore 'em with this warning
wanting the glory of our advance fire ants to water beetles
free masons adjacent debasing on pins and needles
pupil turned pedagogue benedicts into my dream
beam in a billion bottle rockets off the golden mezzanine
i pluck the pedals off a classic blood rose one at a time
gripping the stem and right invite the thorns to dig up in my lifeline
a metaphor for nighttime, ante up the slight cost of exhaustion
to salute the moon of our paradise lost and you're a spectator
stringent, inch by sacred inch shoveling colon in my earthworm soul
borough up through the dirt with bloody digit lick my knuckles clean
noting the corporate clusters holding hands round the abode of the dam
and what's your poison? starlight and amaze her with a nicotine chaser
sip it clean savor the taste then sit and dream later
the ollage pay their back upon they hinges twenty miles
across the glassy eye window of one less to passes by
now i'm six foot four with a sick flow walk up just to recline
with no free time, the alarm storms at nine
my daytime's on some, yes sir, okay sir, right away sir
sir do you mind if i breathe sir oh you do? well excuse me sir fuck you
i breathe slow, i'm running with these fantastic amalgams
painting casket bound careers to pierce gunning with classic albums
security's the javelin, catch it; labor
clocked in at seven six and haven't clocked out ever since
trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
i milk my habitat for almost everything i want
sometimes i take it all and still can't feel this pitfall in my gut
and i'm like must not sleep must warn others
trust blocks creep where the dust storm hovers
i'm trying to walk on top of sunshine
but it's ridiculous at times that's why i tore 'em with this warning
jiggy-jabberjaw vitamin idol and primal rages
when bible page verse tidal waves has begun
i wrote the book that shook america to splinters
call barren moon childs and proud gimps to clinch this chemical war pig
delinquent sinkin' like a paper tugboat
beached on a red tide infested shore corroding eastern seaboard beauty
i'm a jigsaw slab, but all the pig saw was dirt bag
it's like a bleeding comet bombing on your sequels
to the riverside park tunnel people claim last life form standing
my stilts truly personify the serbonite flea circus
i catapult brain opera past basic
tear my own face off in the finale, stick around it's ill
if you had one more eye, you'd be a cyclops
bliss mimic, baptise, chastise, laugh die
kiss the finish, piss the villagers the fuck off
pete piper picked peppers, and run rocked rhymes
aes rock might've smoked one too many dimes in his time
now where you gonna be when the sun falls, brother
probably gathering your sheep with all these other mothafuckers
struck twice in the same place by a moody zues fishliner
smackin the third clear out the park
going gone
i rocked for a flock of chewbacca look-alikes in magic makers
hermit crabs and new york city sewer alligators
and avoid manufacturing food for landfills
i've seen friends bow to needles
i've seen needles bow to records
i've seen god bow and make the clouds shake
i've seen a lot for a blind soldier
who tattooed the city scape up skin to blend in
rats travel by night invite the waterbugs
i'm here to pull the three-prong
when it's prime directive wormhole of self-sacrifice
had a hatchet slice for camps
starving your style to someday be a story in my ?
life's peachy like james and the giant
and i keep spittin' as long as these kittens buy it
and i keep casting my line as long as these officials bite it
and i like it
ban away temper tantrum, decrepit anthem
set a low go, i arrived late
i'm here to scrape a car clean to the funk machine
imposes on the underling amalgam cluster and identifies the mother
i hate to tell you but it skips more than it palpitates
like these here drunken little archers missed one of they calculate
i hate em all, i kick the bottom brick out shouting "yes y'all"
and blow the village out perspective
do you take this makeshift-candy land-cold classic-bastard style
to be your lawfully wedded head trip
doing base throughout sickness, health, electrical storm
fire, pain, rain, hail, wind, ice, sleet, snow?
i'm balanced, personified phantom to the bone
scalpin' a pair of one-way tickets to shadowboxing
like this
you drop science like don herbert with liquor in him
soundin' off like senior citizens sitting at bingo parlor bickering
yeah it's kinda funny, isn't it
how i can build while you just sit there and bitch about your syllabus
dwarfed by the lights, bewildered by the fanbase
bound by an idea, skeptical of the handshakes
well they were selfish with the helmets on the little bus 'til break fluid sewage crippled up the get retarded nickle punks. slowly cope, but swore his lowly robot foley folk would one day rise in sections to interrogate the holy ghost. holy smokes, father, black suit, white collar, kiddy porn dungeon, guns and 3 fingers for your daughters caught belly up. antique nazi paraphernalia. you cannot pay your bills with holy water and hail mary luck. shucks, fucker, enjoy the alcatraz shower fun and mommy's mad i'm cliche generation x agnostic fron. it ain't the nifty faith of 1958 before the new new testament approved altar boy fisting rape and take me to your leader, long as he don't manipulate toddler beaver .call me crazy but i'd bet that wasn't god's demeanor. sodometere peaking. but long island was jesus every weekend, spoon-fed to appease traditional upbringing of a middle pennsylvania shit hole where elder's movement stressed a stellar therapeutic bible cycle. one church with a bait and tackle store next door and not much more. so the two moved to new york, made babies raised on what they'd saw. christmas morning smelled fresher than angel pussy, but immaculate conception came second to playful goodies. like laser tag as way more spiritual than blood and body wafer bags and manger staff as long as santa ate the cookies. grandma was a saint while he'd paint with snakes and bullies, said "if only you'd memorize your prayers like you did your cool g." see by the time i's old enough to know what religion was, i's catholicism numb and truly didn't give a fuck. '94 moved out the crib and ain't seen a steple since, while knievel evil seeps in the christian leaders pitch. 'til priest lap slapped with parental advisory warnings, i'll be auditioning gods in my office on monday morning.
uh-oh, and yet another pill slip down the hatch. it patch him through the kill switch. i need a couple a's for q's. i'm not an asshole, i'm just a little confused.
just a little bruised in the back of the pews, acting amused with a mask on them vatican blues, for in the eyes of the organization i was raised in, aes is just another sinning brick in hell's basement. cubicle adjacent to the killers and rapists. for what? drugs and fucking part of growing up. like cuffs over dumb shit is better than the schools. i'm not an asshole, i'm just a little confused. just a lit fuse in the back of the pews watching a thousand flavors of the same god feud. i figure ultimate peace is the common theme, so it's a no-brainer peace when the blood hit the screen. i got a basic good and evil sensibility born. good neighbor know a halo wouldn't fit over horns. i'm more science than faith, i'm more karma than bread and booze. i'm not an asshole, i'm just a little confused.
zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
via the study of post-adolesent agitated seeds
half the patients wasted self pride at commencement
so i focus on the urban oxygen samples, the hot that made it breathe
they sold pompeii impression, waste infections
cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
the give-it get-it, never let it self pass the word, eyeing stubbornness
martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting spartacus
and someone, i've thrown long hail mary bombs
toward cookie-cutter mother natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
they tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
i'll be waking with the best of routine caffiene team players
under a dusted angel heartstring big brother is watching
my odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
we got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
for copper pennies for one commanding "gimme that"
so we can retain baby fat
holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
bent barrel one eight zero, you'll turn, squeeze, ending
it can roast my leaky finance
i'll take my seat atop the brooklyn bridge
with a coke and a bag of chips
to watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
sometimes i laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
i tend to underestimate my average
someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
'cause every dog has its day
at which point, i'll pull it away
now we the american working population
hate the fact that eight hours a day
is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
and we may not hate our jobs
but we hate jobs in general
that don't have to do with fighting our own causes
when we'd rather be supporting ourselves
by being paid to perfect the pasttimes
that we have harbored based solely on the fact
that it makes us smile if it sounds dope
let's display the purpose that these stilts serve
elevate the spreading of the silk germ
trying to weave a web but all that i believe in is dead
nah brother, it's the year of the jackal
shackle up the hassle by the dooming legend marriage
i just hope my legacy matches
dry as sand, parched, damn get these men some water
in meaningless wars so you don't have to bother
and can sit and soak the idiotbox trying to fuck their daughters
man it's the year of the orphan
seated adjacent to the firefly circling the torches on your porches
trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met
but all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat
maybe it's the year of the waterbug
your response, dreaming of your next of kin
i'm still dealing with this mess i'm in
i've been the object of your ridicule
god it's the year of the underpaid employee
and trying to rape earth on my off time
you bought dizzy, i can't keep myself busy enough
and i'ma let you think you won
hate the fact that eight hours a day
is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us
and we may not hate our jobs
but we hate jobs in general
that don't have to do with fighting our own causes
hate the nine to five day-in day-out
but we'd rather be supporting ourselves
by being paid to perfect the pasttimes
that we have harbored based solely on the fact
that it makes us smile if it sounds dope
you should package it with a last smoke and six feet of rope
her lips wet a very particular mischief,
sis' wiggle an index if your limbs let,
or settle for a warm burgundy bubble out of her beak instead,
had his liver scuba suit up on the sabbath. his personal pale rabbit,
at the hole's end her delicate mitten tipped,
for sticking pissy liquor in him every day at 6,
fully, pattern had her awkwardly christening the small talk chalk board,
she said "this is less of a 'fixer-upper' than my last bar".
funny, you're less of a 'fixer-upper' than my last whore.
crass is similak to the milky wit of todays youths, both chuckle out.
next couple on the couch, swapping social coma rants,
the key to open his closure:
pussy plus yay she hid is a broken toaster, and later wake neighbors over chemical flavor to fuck sickly,
tooth/nail beauty through the skin deep.
an object at rest, tends to remain at rest
and an object in motion, tends to remain in motion
now the dizziness is similar to whimsy with a pretty twist,
if pretty is a bidding war for meteors of iffy sniff,
and cigarettes and pills on the speaker silhouetted by the muted television and the rickety venetians,
between tweaks he sweeps at home depot and reads,
mostly biblical but not cuz he believed, but found the lexicon of jesus-heavy literature fly,
feverishly sponged up the information high,
fade into the cradle of his same deck train wreck,
she pet him with a mechanical tape deck play back,
plus the depressing sum of the 2 combined pay checks,
stung less when little debbie d-cup put her legs back,
drunk, put her on the business end of his favorite couplet from corinthians,
sunk into the comforts of a kid again,
enough to share the stuff that truly interest him,
this is where the vision of a shiny happy christmas end,
tipsy little princess wasn't listening, just yes-ing him,
the more she fed him "yes", the more he fed her fresh barbiturates,
assuming it was them against the world into oblivion,
but he was just a stupid simian that let her live with him
an object at rest, tends to remain at rest
and an object in motion, tends to remain in motion
pirouetting madly on a mirror full of baggies
in the valley of the irritable aggie,
any sincerity, miracles,or memory buried in the back-seat by the hazardous material was seriously gasping,
trying to patch up the attraction,
figured he would win her back if he act in a common passion,
penned a couple chapters about a sassy pair of magnets with a cottage on a hill and a picket fence and a marriage,
never having gathered her rabid enthusiasm over language was fashioned around the aspirin his cabinets,
asked her to read it expecting flattery after the fact,
this is an exact imitation of how she react:
"you ain't shit man, your story's a joke,
you should package it with a last smoke and 6 feet of rope",
and she know 5 chores, more coke and all fours,
said "leave me on the floor and leave the dope by the door".
bounced all shook up, she cook up aluminum,
consuming every skull and crossbones in the room in under 2 minutes,
he fuming with a flipped lid,
and found her body on the tiles,
her lips wet a very particular mischief
sis' wiggle an index, if your limbs let
or settle for a warm burgundy bubble out of her beak instead
an object at rest, tends to remain at rest
and an object in motion, tends to remain in motion

well, it appears the scars of learning have spoken.
some deserve tall tales, some wrote 'em.
some are just a brutal reprecussion of devotion.
mine are all of the above 'cause everything leads to erosion.
now where i live there's a homeless man.
yeah, he makes a rusty trumpet sound like the music that angels make.
now if you ever come and visit me, i suggest you watch the show

"we'll have more news after this commercial word"
"at least i think i was here asleep
is it possible, conceivable that i sleepwalked out of my apartment
fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
escaped briefly back to my apartment
and reminisce about the day i ran a mile with your heart in my hand
'tesants get the new york home game
i told this cat the earth was flat
he walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself for being stupid
spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
godspeed tequila worm future, be concerned
my feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
while my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
i'ma never give, i'm juiced off ejection
i'm stubborn as a thousand born agains avoiding questions
i bake the date up for my pledge
to 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
not a creature stirred, it reaks of subway metal
feather lecture journalist chin on fish shenanigans
mummified manequins with future cleanse adamant
this a malcom circus, got a ring of fire
just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
i'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you sucka!
i lay the law down upon its belly
with my foot dug in between the third and fourth disc
i'm the actualized data commission past penny tip jar donation

took a heart pledge early on
lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
sensation'll leave siesomgraph stabbin away on stone tablets
to sketch up out your future
i drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
but have canceled developed, courtesy america
home of the triplicate grill character
my sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
it citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
i rock a crooked lid piece
a sweat a bit to make my wookie ends meet
pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
where they whine on some 'daddy's gonna kill ralphy' shit
sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit apparently
parasol spinnin casually like 'i'm an artist, please don't laugh at me'
ok, time to buckle the fuck down
side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
you can catch the memoir in several dimensions
the joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process

i didn't mean to cause all that destruction
"that i sleepwalked out of my apartment and went berzerk?"
this is how the city-folk and mole-people connect-nect
somebody warped the message, tried to pass it to the next next
harvest all brand-x clark kents to worm food
carbon heart, buried his nozzle in fossil marker art
pardon, cadaver had a legitimate pulse
and littered volts all over the village where the skittish pigeons molt
bastard polter-gasps when the pigeon with lazarus billy-goat whiskers
he roasted sea-salt in the open blisters
but blind anarchy slips through the cracks
see naked martyrs with bubblelicious on fishing rods itching to pull it back
with that organic invention incubated to have some ?? to make it through
?? on paper now, a lot of details later
and lot of crews will taper out
a wooly mayor souse, who ?? happy shooting at the bladed mouth
bazooka tooth zoo-keep the paper route with janky funds and favors
cradled by twelve empty zelda heart containers
man, it's freezing in this brick bitch, winter forever
like punxatawny phil found with his four furry wrists severed
i walk face-first through the sex, drugs, and church
with wild things that make maurice sendak question his early works
out the clock corporate constant sprockets
running from a rabid ring-wraith click basilisk
serpentine, in and out of traffic jam and murder scenes
scrub blood of the af-152, pick up first degrees
some toddlers smuggled tommy guns and crack into the nurseries
dog, there's a fucking baby at the door asking for wallets
and those ain't twin beanie babies inside his pockets
2010 sonograms showed the magnum formed directly out the fetus
evolution for the young killer convenience
this is how the city-folk and mole-people connect-nect
somebody warped the message, tried to pass it to the next next
this is how the hermit and the busy bee connect-nect
somebody's losing track of their flesh-and-bloods and arrests-rests
polka-dotted landscapes, what did you expect-pect?
now a-days, even the babies got guns
misplace the bottle, might catch a bad one
have a mid-life crisis when you're ten years young
if this jesus piece around your neck is bigger than your pistol
it makes homicide okie-dokie and your god will forgive you
just show the saints at heaven's gate you should be on the list
"i heard he overlooks manslaughter for a tattooed crucifix"
twisty, fishy, contradicty, wild animal ship fleet
off the sliding board dock of the mr. turtle pool mom bought
somewhere they laminate dry bones and cool water and ease medulla
after you thumb-suck and diaper-change get burped and shoot the school up
i'd do it too, but only to exploit no-brainers
teenager beef passed alligator teeth and extra-curricular flagpole scrapping
amongst tadpoles that have yellow backbones
de-mechanism brought airborne shrapnel scraps to hassle captains
by the itchy index of an umbilically-garped fraggle baby
chopped shop and a mislead, maladjustee trustee locked box
hiding clips that light the sky in seconds
like newly communal hop-scotch gives them leverage
cut them with mortars while i mumble
in the immortal slang of mushmouth for the anti-led nirvana
i used to think i'd get hit by a bus or something dumb and dumber
that or bust the slugs plugged by the newest kiddie thug wonder
self-victim kings who rep a wide pride dosage
for tomorrow the holsters are bound to outnumber the roaches
but that won't even jolt the immobile
when global terrorism's all the rage and folk get smoked local
block, if you need me
i had to bounce to dc
to bullet-proof mom's flower garden before the war cheats me
if i'm not back in a week tell the crew i said "peace" and lay low
this is how the city-folk and mole-people connect-nect
somebody warped the message, tried to pass it to the next next
this is how the hermit and the busy bee connect-nect
somebody's losing track of their flesh-and-bloods and arrests-rests
polka-dotted landscapes, what did you expect-pect?
now a-days, even the babies got guns
misplace the bottle, might catch a bad one
have a mid-life crisis when you're ten years young
the day i got the phone call jam master jay died
so now i'll probably never write another "daylight"
because the stingers ?? a ?? into the portable hay-rides
it adds it up when a pioneer fall, in comparison to your 99 bottle of beer wall
there's banana peels in your hamster wheels, hand cannons in your shoebox, please
mine's got adidas, rest in peace
i was a dark dumb student, no hokey rookie daytrippin on visions of chickens that looked like r crumb drew em. they grew em in the royal dirt of suffolk countys flooring with the blood of an alcoholic clergyman in his forearms. long island was porn stars and puppies pushing sniffles, fit into the eighth dimension or slipped through the pin holes, ?zoop? slipped through the pin holes, ?crisped into god cinder?. who thunk over a quarter plunked a local ?mortal con? vendor.
who broke the verbal squad sensor? root down, feelers out across the marsh before it was awesome car! i called in car cavalry cooked in an 85 dodge aries, gas for huntington and back barely. equipped with super soakers full of piss and an uncanny knack for constantly upsetting pigs by doing stupid shit. the kid ?bartered? his ring king dummies to king cullen where they hollered fuck the world from a parking lot of the suburbs. a couple spray cans and a little litter, but theyd look at us like swindlers with them ricky kasso jitters. so fuck em, a glutton sunk into the alley for props but things will still go bump when them halogens pop. believe. ill be there when it happens so shake another place off the mantel, snake another flames off the candle, lady of the lake off the answers, admitting their mistakes to their ?deplaning? cadavers. now its rest in peace when peters ?sinner heaters sung? disturbingly referred to reevaluate your beast of burdens urgency. damn doggy, good times, thanks. i wrote your name in wet cement by the brooklyn banks.
? smack? for later. made a fire, made a wheel, made a snack for later. catacomb kids cuddle up and test the paper. when the town's speed freaks sleep, trap the traitor. he will ask for papers. ?see im a nice invader?, made a roof, made a weapon, made a flag from paper by the snotty little nuzzle of a latchkey neighbor. when the ?pope does shaggy? over some dap from gators, he will catch the vapors.
couple playboy mudflaps and hell on his heels. blew the plea echoed in a pace with your shovelers meals, like not a farmer among us had a harvest survive the winter. so dinner is split a lima bean in triplets. pick a winner. we took a couple of summers puking pills behind the dumpster, it was the largest pez dispenser on record recouped his numbers. one shoe in the soupy gutter, one shoe in the velvet heaven. when the mermaids haul em, shake em up the lake with a ?melted weapon secret?. dance ?prudey? with the rule of a nation, who will be patient, awaiting zookeeper facelift extra. the days of your pain and similar uber apeshit, we merely updated the ancient apage. yeah, dumber than a gal on a roof in a flood, whos not as dumb as the watered down beef from the burgers that jumped. im dumber than a taz on a beach chair with a martini, whos not as dumb as a tat with the same scenery. ?walking female? pig stigmata for all good sport. garbage pail kids unite at the mall food court. chase cheese fries with binaca. they had shut the school down early, there were bombs inside the lockers. no concept of the problem, we responded like a snow day, it was clobber shit to flotsam but the cops said it was ok. ok so the squadrons back into their boxes like its breakfast club of hotheads show no progress to the doctors.
and i walk into the office, cough an awful ether often, flood a parking meter fever, knuckle up the love and rockets. it was reign of the razor laser, day of the cloudy howdy, flight of the shelter melter, you can bow without me.
knock em out the box, aes.
i take 10 steps with a bed lamped vision
study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village
i understand the plagues and shake hands with my grimace that remain up in
my face like top to bottom train car feelings
lets question the ascension of a broken social icon in various domino affect
i'm blow this hex over the mission
just to administer the indoor sucker punch to it's pitiful condition
with no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
that's so much of a lie, you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
as the truth hits your ears begin to cry
'why is it like this!' why the fuck do i care?
i don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear
city lights look like bright groups of fire flies
many see the truth  only when the liar dies
tires screech to a halt, the ground cries
spit sparks speak to the streets
read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals]
the hopeless stay hopeful
as i walk out my door, step into the pollution
exhale solutions
physically the situation's hard to stop
i had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
casualties in this apocalypse
faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via donahue
table talk, salt and pepper conversation
it's a conspiracy , i can't lie dukes
sometimes i feel the rats got a better deal than i do
it goes thieves, bandits, low lives, scum
punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
steadily searching for something new under the sun
but its stagnant, act of development first of madness
punks that buckle under the rumple of my drum
steadily searching for something new under the sun
but its hurtin, act of development first diversion
a new universe in ancient, so i stay patient
in a gravel pit, travelin thoughts and ravelin, pacing
embracing light of america, and found a shade of darkness
the train car used to be my apartment
sick of people rushin in the doors before i get out
conductors closing the doors before i get in, i shout
'the biz is coming, the biz is coming!'?
don't get worried now
you're movin much to fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass
its delicate demeanor and i teach you how to hang
but we like 1970 something twenty clicks outside your name
i apologize for the faulty academics
but they placed us in a miserable stasis
but tryin to see eye to eye with the face lift
just ain't working the way the manual paints it
see i soak in a blue note factory
while most cats hassle bandits lamping solo
and when the last red brick topples over the earth
to intercept your crooked little mess
i can be found in a social coma directly to your left
engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath
regarding how to document the shady baby steps
i bounce checks like a modern
sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
together specimens from the promise land
this for the merchants allergic to they own stingers
this for the absurd verdict linkers
this for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions
but can't remember where his drink is
i'm wallowing, shrugging i'm plugging your corporation
'cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation
when all that's said and done
are you a memorable troop or just a lab rat on the run
i start my city with a brick
then add another brick
brick by brick, i manufacture homes for fallen angels
i ain't no great samaritan, that's just the way the game goes
respect the polars but acknowlege middle-value rainbows
my snout turned up from dream factory eyelids
slingin bottled prosperity for the kamikaze colonels
yeah rocks the match that burned the nazi journals
and plottin verticals amidst blatantlly horizontal
models then swallowed by famished potholes
killer cottoncandy clouds and huckleberry justice league
wild aes scream through your style to hear the echo
aight then, flinch for the great granddaddy payback
when little billy bought a tugboat
now he thinks he's captain ahab
facist takes more than pegleg's birds and eyepatches
learn that lesson, you'll be swashbuckling with the best of them
wonder why you wept over spilled milk
and got your crayons wet, the room reaks of a thousand bayonettes
i'll fision vision with a lie longer than your most walked meridian
connecting life with that little species of idiots
we've now officially scraped barrel bottom
aesop rock an apple to the core but ya'll ignored him
i know a planet made of porcelain
and once i get tired of holding this gavel up
ya'll prayer circles met him up born again
i ain't too good for tap water
for a ballad, corpse a dead man walkin
you can lead a man to a city but that don't assure civility
you can beat a man to death with aesop rock bootleg cd's
i speak in farenheit and burn off colon lyric
diss blatant harassment, spit honor, whistle fearless
don't dismiss the billygoat appearance for that common sheep
chorus
slogans coined, songs have been written
the hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
moving boxes have been worn out
idols idolized, the sands have been shifted
the hourglass smashed and didn't leave me an escape
i picked locks of thoughts vault
only the tree of life flourishing
wanting to take a bite but i'm toothless
is that, predestination or is it by design?
that i'm trapped in time sand
show radio mission control but for my rhymes
man 'cause i can like aluminum
for any action or lack thereof there's a consequence
where heartless spines awake to devour
the small piece of your soul that's left
soaked in pockets where lives topics lack conceptual, ridicule
the night breathes but light's choking
for genre i'm told when has-beens attempt
to cause heat to rise and wonder why they're trapped in cold
life's an oragmi box and i'm hidden within the fold
so when the yarn unravels, i won't be caught by surprise
and as society's fabric of orthodoxes dismantle
i'll see you embracing the pentagram within this crucifix disguise
see when the canvas stands before me
i'm compelled to spill a vision
for the sinners that listen, i got three spikes and a thorned crown
it seems i need a new soul 'cause mine is worn down
but from the pregance of my hardship was born style
still my pen bleeds and stains the paper with thought
finding me lost among statues of mainstream idols
drowning in melted ice to reinforce that breath is vital
if your father and his father were fish out of water
how many times must a plant be uprooted for it to die?
when it's smothered with lies that abolish the potency of the sky
so when the stars burn out and god replaces the bulbs
and throws the switch, sparks filament
i stand on my own two aura illuminated in red
showcasing the agony held within this welded spirit
sacrificing itself for the health of a masocistic culture
yearning for the truth that we speak but refuse to hear it
it goes welcome the pop off, some pop soft. we bang b-bang b-bang bang out loud. ready on the left with a face full of death. we slanged out fang mouth bang out now.

watchin' the rainbows peak,
i mean, it's all the same to some
but that cityscape makes me numb
walkin' the wire between firewater and water - i'll take the tap
and still manage to end up thirsty the day the nursery collapsed
in my hand i hold the plumage of a buzzard
suffered for circlin' nutrition
i may have just saved your children
there's an inborn tendancy tellin' me to grip that sickle
for the pirate tyrant breeds feed on your precious little pixels
i interviewed the sun, he said the future's lookin' bright
i interviewed the rain, he claimed the sun's truly an asshole
i's supposed to interview the snow today but of course he flaked
so i let my frigid demeanor teeter and take his vacant place
we 3 sprout from the same litter
yet amazingly crafted by seperate scissors
i sloth from off the beaten path splashed in the cretin blizzard
half my time is herded towards little lost causes
half my time is spent pluggin' these leaky faucets
an' i'm here to pose inquiries
i'm here to draw a fork in the road and call it the diary of common sheep aspiring
little billy starlet up the block got the right premise
but can't thread the needle without consultin' apprentice present.
now i don't really know you
but i dont' really care
can't judge a man's dignity by the wattage in his stare
maybe that deem's be that vagabond you'd love to kill
but i really ain't got time for the all the motherfucking guilt.
i'm gone tonight. you best believe i'm leavin'
packing my belongings then it's off into the evening
i haven't exactly been embraced by the populace
set sail upon the 7 deadly seas of the annonamous
packing my belongings then it's off into the evening
i'm diggin' a tunnel to where the sun will never shine
i got my book, i got my dream, i've got myself and i'll be fine
is the day before the day the earth stood still
is the day before the soldiers fired at will
is the day before the hunter made his kill
my time's the final mile before the valley meets the hill
parked where the farmers barter appetites
sweet-talkin' harrassment down to a mere flashing of badges
prototypic landscapes chased every step of my well-oiled collective workforse with frozen intention festive. wait.
well i am the product of skeleton dancers poised crooked scattered amidst blue fields of firey bliss mixed
with disease applicant activist rattlers, fascinate grave child
oh you're expecting slave smiles after sticking the pin in limb and
god, if i could offer maintenance of fantasies i would
i'd place the button in the city square for everyone to push
you see my mission responsibilties range across the board
and still i'd rather be a pen than a sword
i was not ready
all edgy and out of shape, made the company look messy
honestly take it or leave it
just let me know so i ain't beggin' forgiveness thoughout the evening.
basic locomotive with a whistle and caboose
tryin'a pull my cargo 'cross the map without a boost
fragile in more ways then 10 yet sturdy bird construction
hope the smoke stacks puff into the morn, dream torn
i'm gone tonight, you best believe i'm leavin'
packing my belongings then it's off into the evening
i'll knock upon every little door that comes about
i'll sweep your porch if you can spare a couple of breadcrumbs and a couch.
packing my belongings then it's off into the evening
this turning in my sleep is getting old and older still
and then there were eight .
.
this is little russian dolls that get smaller and smaller still.
this is a corpus full of pills, trying to sit still and build.
cause eight planets bullied number nine until he fell.
i brought that genuine shit in '96
before you knew the underground or independent existed
i watched the whole scene straight jump on the dick
after stepping to kcr lit and flexing my shit
no gun talk, no gimmicks, just rounds of raw dogging
dirty dusty intelligent wit and word murdering
a hardcore poetic informed without burglary
potent and shook the shit out of rappers who just learned of me
everytime i prescribe a new pill, revolution
quickly defined the standard for indie rap distribution
arrogant unafraid shit developed riding a train thinking of brain fucks
bad touch example, that soon became bucks
had everybody sprung wondering where i came from
screaming out, independent as fuck, with an insane tongue
with an indelible squad of design monsters
innovating the styles that made biters look like imposters
so we scripted an album and signed to rawkus
selling a hundred thousand without a radio chart hit
imposterous son is taking the world hostage
classic hip hop bombage dirty with style progress
now i've come from the '80s juvenile brooklyn
where cats was like gimme that subway pass, kid. good lookin
now someone else is taking a ride with what's mine
so i had to develop styles with a death device cooked in
so when i battled in basements i had eight sentences
waiting ready for the four you had laced in
and i was taught to wait patient, why?
only faggots make shit up just to get famous
so when i finally blew up i remained sick
earning respect in ghettos and 'burbs for word placement
back when the independent scene remained faceless
we were the only crew who promised your ass we'd take it
mold it, shape it, living outside the matrix
hold it, make it, more than miniature major labels
hold it sacred, living it for the culture
told ya plainly, protected it from the vultures
that's why i always get respect from true soldiers
that laugh at the critics claiming every year hip hop's over
fuck you, hip hop just started
it's funny how the most nostalgic cats are the ones who were never part of it
but true veterans'll give dap to those who started it
then humbly move the fuck on and come with that new retarded shit
new slang, new thought, new sound, new heart, you thought you hang
i won't dumb it down, i'm dumbing now for these rounds
i'm a live mothefucker plus i'm gunning for clowns
you're a mime motherfucker, don't be coming for pounds
till you can break out of that invisible box, you're not down
my favorite ones are the ones who started out young rappin about
comic books, spaceships, and omnicron 1
and even though they were soft they had fun
but they couldn't break out the frame of the town they came from
some of these faggots used to send me their demos
keeping their puppy styles in the company flow kennels
but since they had no identity from the start
they started to resent the scene when they couldn't become a part
they've been failing for years and call themselves vets, that's bold
motherfucker, you're not a vet you're just old
i'll slap the shit out you to continue my nerd rap
making this money fist over fist, fuck what you heard
rookie cats talk about boom bap and golden ages
pat themselves on the back for making that new outdated shit
but i've been putting out vinyl since '93 and never looked back once
at ya'll trying to chase me
it's not a choice despite what you might tell your boys
keep your identity crisis under the table
i always knew who i was and i'll always be more famous
for the best in the bendor biz
leave the last ce, off for crabs and bobbin hatorade
dig it, daddy dug his own tunnel under the gutters where the numbers bleed
hunters froze up and exposed rapunzel weeds
tugboat, tug a rut out brutal dirt first
the fuedals fuming oodles, it was right under your poodle skirt
welcome to bazooka works, halogen halo eyesore
the revolution will not be apologized for
warbucks exlex megaphone on the fashion piggy pageant
while my dick's raw dogg in a style magnet
fraggle rock your four figure watch
i clock ninety nine cent wristbands
and still know the time when you record flops
and this is on a sick with it factor
exhibit a, e, s, genesis of the klepto reactor
wanna burgle the buzz over definitive cast
after a life of labor camps starts paying innovaters back
baby, you ain't felt the collect?, coooool
stuck running bases with little bears under the wing of punchdrunk butter makers
that engine sputters while the hound dogs wire cutter mechnical
rabbit bantomweight puppies ain't rabid enough to snatch him
poplock dynamos, is approached with a golden focal point
come soak in it, resume sturdy composer soldier bliss
wrong name by a molar can often expose your phobias
watch a cobra grow hands to hold his own tongue when he notices
all city legity critter, bark with me
all filthy documents, cats piss on their kittie litter moccasins
welcome to mi casa, monsters inc, dropping bangers out the rocket ships
you wanna read the nile, i twitch easy reader
wide open with banged out cutlery from a slang mouth teacher
and money is an ugly god we all fall for
i got land mammal, cannibal, natural survival squackbox
that means when i wake up and decide to comprise the new shit
it's not some watered down version of what my favorite crews did
rappers stuffed komonos and shark fame at a perfect working unit
b boy, feed that to the needy
shut your liquor hole, fuck you in 3d
shoop the local wendy cooper loopy
she asked me, "what's the name?"
i flashed the grossest fangs in show biz
5 o'clock with the ten-penny sum
sprung colassal miss, may i process your pentium?
the pigeon holing roles that your predecessor's lunacy in the kismet"
her eyes googled back "?that want to fortune to? breed plus a new kink in the posture
get p.t. barnumed in 3d thx sound stereo dismissal
sorry hun, it's just the last ?group? was a fistful
like them girls you bump into like dumb luck
get high in the city kiss once when she's punch drunk
watch her misinterpret the moment tongues touch
crazy mc-clingalot claim instant one love
and you've gotta beg your friends to take 'em off your hands like thumbcuffs
or them barbies you'll vibe for a sexy second
give 'em a month hyde hekyl to jekyl and she makes hitler look cuddly
but jenny in the sky with emerald eyes
you're so different so delicious so ?de fish?
i'd be willing to walk the limb with
i'm clinically bonkers and just about everyone god's great earth offers
i won't be getting dressed up to impress your family dear

"i dream of jeannie and fucking her obsecenly
but jeannie could be jenny so easily if you'd let me

like i want to be an anstronaut after you marry me"
"you're rushing this i feel smothered it's crowding me awfully, dolly
i love you, get the fuck off me! sorry."
and i'm circling her like a tiger shark frenzied but friendly
"i'm cool, how you feeling jenny?"  jenny
"so quiet, oh i like that, so mysterious, i dig it
the way you haven't made eye contact with me once in ten minutes
i'm just saying girl, i'm dirty-dog raw vintage mixed with mega-low society
mister gutter-fuck ?head? if you try me
so there it is, game. i mean it's not like i'm sweating you
because when it comes down to it, most of y'all females are the same
but now it's your turn baby, spit it out"
"okay" she punched me dead in the fuckin mouth and walked away
watch out ladies cause you know he don't love ya
he's a low life pimp with a low life game
he needs a no life dame with a strobe light frame
but if you love television and
and we can make it happen
just leave your bag up on my curb with the trashcan

wing of wax, or wing of gold leaf
choose one. float or plummet 20 thousand cold legues
my nourishment's provided in the summer
how y'all chasin' dreams when what's tangible still outruns ya
warm as the march of a billion torches forward to burn what i born at
cut and paste alertness to current set is provided quick
shimmy the pirate ship mast, bat the eyelids at the siren in her bow
facing, let's salute the embrace pertinent generals who turned innocent hermits to burning spectacles.
flirtin' with a serpent workin' overtime
drain the battery, siphon the poison and flood his majesty's hatchery.
i was riding on the yellow bus to where the brush thickens.
yeah, an it ain't exactly plush pickin's
i'd rather take the time to burn every last bridge i've ever crossed beneath the sun
than live my life knowin' you may one day follow me over one.
caught up in the wake of the red witch tryin' to swim it.
ran for the sake of dead click stripped of idealic image
steal a sloppy earth meal feed my pottery wheel to model collossal vision
thrill, shrunken with a bucket of pennies
i'ma drag my sneakers through the dirt like alligator bellies
honour and a loud thirst submersed in a trap
in a city of garbage, tryin' to reap the harvest
adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
swing your little axe or be an oak tree if you can
either way, adapt to circumstance or play you final hand.
no enigma, an attempt to bury the hatchet
rendered me victim of deviltry plus wounded like stigmatics
i smell an inch of differnce in this mornin's pollution pistons and how the loose ends drift in
my sour pash  institutions slipped in admidst the invaders and,
this garden's grown fucken' acres since my visit.
itchin' to count the layers in the blizzard to that chapter where my family inserts the dagger and twists it.
it's the carnival, have you any sweets for my weary kin
it's the carnival, have you any feed for my cheery grin
it's the carnival, welcome, play our games you'll never win
coz it's that carnival where every freak show spectacle's your friend.
ghostly galleon, tossed upon cloudy seas
antifreeze to glacier cookin' a look of fiery nature
ceilin' feelin' too heavy to bless the i-beams for a fraction more collapse  that to your door.
bitchin' my back to hell's kitchen, back
burnin' murder machinery, released regardless of the pardons
hitchin my life to the leash of one minstrel
sick of same window different visual
play, coopertive supercolony clash
ooh, i duel this underdog verse forced adaption to the marbles of the now
since then my knuckles haven't once dragged on the ground.

adaption is the trap in which the artist meets the forest
swing your little axe or be an oak tree if you can
either way, adapt to circumstance or play you final hand.
the ritual goes, same window different visual.
the ritual is same fucken' window different visual.
my polar halfs negotiate it
shook upon the difference between tumble weed and sacred,
read a hostel gospel attributed to land shark apostle squad
unfroze the hideous image like ??? ???.
bat up in the bell free
i wana be the reinvention of fire
in a most stagnate tension basket
fenced in a cognitive learning facility built with the makers of stinger repellent,
but fresh as the active element.
draggin bricks roped to a saturn atlas hooked to madness
and i swear my new fresh air till the goblet cried, fuck the rabbits and rose
most soloists cant defend the might kingdoms that their passengers propose, thats why i am the rose.
spring water aint enough any more
i wana see the river and bottle my own crystal drizzle liquid dinner
well arent we the phoenix of irritant method
here to steer the flock out the farmland while every shepherd rested
with a, head on the wall
i be the head shaker in a sea of nodding novelty dolls
touch the skull of each and everything
but the masters had em walking in circles like eye patches
one element to many to made a hungry man moan
ill be leavin now
ill be leavin now
ill be leavin now
no ill be leavin now
follow your hunch and align the hunt collection
to count their blessings in abundance.
once in a crescent moon ill adapt
to capture the essences breakfasts participants fishin dissin inventions.
heads gather from every battered aspect of the march
who born in what city and
and it gets tiring wiring the populace an anti grin and list of accomplishments
stick figures stand at attention, deficit
and alls well that blends well with a warm hazardous combine
i bullied the wooly mammoth and champs
germany frantic decamped to the wino migration, examine.
eager to sport motley mosaic illustrate more than pendragon
im from a room flooded with punishment
ive seen drunken sailors pilot they vessels to split the light house
laugh at brown bag liquor list on there way home from the blood bath
half angle with broken halo; half primitive rug rat.
spoken for by wide life, hybrid mutations and slum cats
see i wait a lifetime just to pierce these spears though the bellies of every monster.
10 little warriors sit on a picket fence,
ordering themselves for protection of nonsense,
catapult the stone that struck the leader in the back and
marked the beauty as the other 9 warriors worlds collapsed.
one element to many to made a hungry man moan
ill be leavin now
ill be leavin now
ill be leavin now
notice i said id be on my way out the door
i mean the doors almost closed
ill be leavin now forget it
and the saints come marching in
serpentine regime ordered by response sort of fell this population
caboose humming no fence me in a van with common patriots
the parody plastered every red brick in site
where had to keep his plights from ticking
i'm slipping my key and whim dim by dirty tap water and that
roach on my ceiling circular fins round a bed of pushpins
let's connect the thrill of volume to a flat earth
j-walkin a hook the past just passed the mere dragon bandwagon passages
i'm sorry, we've never met, my name is driftwood
thanks friend, good looking, i'll never see you again
feeding frenzy, catfish stomach, empty oceans
spangled in hooks dangle by anglers off the plank of burning books
and if you're, not gonna eat that
kill joy inherited by spirits lacking harnesses
merchant, goliath dipped in slip shy posture conceived evening
so i feed idea turn sun dial to bastards son adopt the reroute dreaming
oh i'll ride the plain bow in flare gully yellow rain coat
heard a harp but sunny ways my lifeline searching for the same note
oh please, i know butterfly wings ain't fit to auction
dig my tossing sturdy walking head hung
skylark litigants strung out like cats straight up participants
i am the triant diaries of a low life siphon through that vein
anti-diligence movement, here the hunger habitat
working class trash raped where racist hit their high
i spy a toddler on the corner with her bubbles and her dipstick
i witness the fusion of her breath and her amusement
and it killed me and it stabbed me and it cut me clear open
the notion that this child timid in her sins embraced pleasure
within a token of a moment, retless arrested but not a twirp
strip the bonabo disclosure, so close yet so much closer
i'll take the hint but still she's never known cold
call me in twenty when those bubbles explode it's like that
back to back to back to stacking a brick match
with the fact that i've sipped the dripping sap tap
casually out the limbs of captivated blends back
tracking the patterns that trim friends to thinning savages
take one down, pass it round among us
lick a tipper drink, drink, drunk, drunk, and drunkest
but you quest tore your floorboards and the carpet turned marbles
naw the carpet turned charcoals and made skeletons of warlords
snake charmer, hate farmer, gave you the rations
with an eyedropper a poison passions hoist above the masses
and interrupts homeostasis seeming flow scapes
like a symmetric snow flake visits and with her symmetry blizzards
i'm sleepy, one wing more and i promise to pay homage
to those who stand truly deserving and the list ain't long
even birds of our combines float if you let them
they'll be dodging more than quiddles when the bowel breaks
note the affiction slip clip to your little visions into cloud shapes
oh my left hand is a brick layer my right hand is a plow face
we build and destroy in response to every sound the crowd makes
sling blanks sprayed it with apathy magic balance
on the palette of the almighty for painting the first half of me
honor find it with monster mashing in text casually
on the palette of the almighty to paint the second fraction
i'm collapsed under the relic rainbow with seven sepriet
succulent aqua marines hide the in by sweetest elixir
star heckler and leaders start gawking at yet another
real conceived green fetus beating parallel sterile fixture
urgent, the serge is like venom and over kill, kill, kill, kill
the over spilled theory's all faucet
for real, how many leaves your clover got? mine's got eight
three for normalcy one for luck four more so you'll spot it from space
the water ain't safe, the land's made of water
i hug a half empty glass my dignity's trying to pawn her
i'm trying to see the future in a tea cup and a saucer
but i rather be drinking coffee with my cigarette foster
and a run away buckle the cloud-nine fantasy filter to force the
of daily market place wars through the roof
i mean i stood beneath the icicles that bleed under the awning
and magically mastered the great absorbing of spirit falling
but i'm sick, i've plowed these fields a thousand times over
sold botanical research studies to farmers with whole quotas
and when science proposes to art besides that peaceful sea
i'll be that cat with a ring on a pillow shouting finally
take a number, the apple seeds rained upon each slumber
a hundred thousand freaks on parade for the village hunter
my every whim acted upon has gone loopy
but i play a game called lets prepare barnacle city for the end-all noosings
i split the radius at go-getter bellies, reconnaissance
seeping fossil genie bottle optimist freeze
run for the fountain but the fountain is a desert optical
tummy full of sand running man impossible stop
there's a wing in my gut and i'm all dust
surf in the urban iditarod certainly flushed
now one in the hands worth two atop the tallest cedar
but what lies inside my heart is off the mother fking meter
see the water ain't safe no more
'i'm just trying to build myself to act as a truly better man
see the water ain't safe no more
'nah nah the water ain't safe no more'
i'm just trying to be a solid oak tree for every child to carve
'the water ain't safe no more'
i'm just trying to be the dream of ever peasant the hurricane
'i'm just trying to be some body i can talk to in the morning
the water ain't safe no more
and i've always been a 40 night chronologic hostage
rusted hook in the lip of the monarch
i don't play in the man race cycle
gloating inside carnal indifference till doom cops are slight
i'm 20 something pumping acrylic tomorrow side ways
blazing passage with a map tattooed on the back of the classless
now tip toe across a lost cause
don't mean you found a cause
that means you found a lost cause
ok now ive been here for role playing
to benefit consumption for my peers steering the plow
handy jackets turn numerals to sentinels
but bad apples ain't sweet and cretins ain't that memorable
i'm mozart with a focus on the tide
hiding the inconsistencies of man behind water and wine
i wear a tiger stripped ego and bivouac my progression
with a kingliness formulated through the flesh of the oppressors
god had a flask i can prove it
you really think the 13 loops that loose daughter
spawned me a sober unit, check potion
addressed the ghost inside my tv with a ruler
at hear to the back bone stone pusher
here ten thousand hackers deep in a movement
that's 20,000 crucial ruby heels clicking in unison
i keep a stick inside my hand
and carve my name inside every wall of the falling hologram
blaze with a face melter, go fish,
pigeon itchin for a pit to put the pig in,
scalped bottom feeder, nose bleeder, cheap seats,
to the meat eater sweeps sweet weak freaks,
grip clicker, smack the dummy box fix picture,
stickle over shit, cinema flicker in the plasma,
the latch key degree was obtained in the savage years,
where he learned the binding of a wire hanger to rabbit ears,
every pixel that leaked dead over the carpet,
had to be spit shinned and hidden before the ford duster parketh,
when mommy marched in, wrapped the broccoli in the napkin,
for your electric paradesio after the parent crashes,
and i'm high on ion jitters,call it a prime directive of the damned,
who grew to sleep easy to white noise,
the humming of the machinary running towards them crawl,
social retardation larvey plugged into the wall,
the little short circuit with the still born vibe,
till the villagers circled and determand "it is alive",
shipped to bell view eyes fuzzy talking funny,
like "eagle one to grey squirrel whats your twenty dunny?",
i piss clumsy with electrode head pan ,
pitty the pretty internet gotta empty the bed pan,
left hand numb from the finger to the thumb ,
right got tubes in it, irony is fun ,
at some point early when drunk on electric kisses,
i'd apparently notarized forms excusing scalp slippage ,
the pain came on a makeshift main stage,
and sentenced to in an inoperable eight bit frame rate,
for that i made a game play, reborn torn,
at the ministry of information trying to get informed,
they'll duck it out and i will cease all wars,
so if you babysit a caroline be fore warned,
i be the ultimate , multi polar,
pockets like maraccas, that will shake when he stepped,
which explains the circle of rattlesnakes where he slept,
smarter then the average bear, barter parts and gadget,
with battery op enthusiast pardon the barking badgers,
while you were parking daggers in kittens with snarling children,
i was sharking classes with taggers for television ,
diagonal mahogony boggled the train savage,
to boxed the botanically inclined child slave labor,
blades clipped the perfect petal now play later,
play never, if escaped raped treasure,
thats a jewel freebie out a old geezer, no teether,
or even yesteryear scrapes fester,administer gauze,
but catourized wounds bleed if you ain't ethered the cause,
king of applause ,
porn king of newyork, alley punk perv scum,
waddle on the voyage of the vouyer,
six four sick king breezer sniff whores through brick,
i am so dangerous evil and mercy heaven,
allergy to compasion he is the perfect weapon,
un- earth it and ciphened from delorian doors swivel up,
with aviator radar blip for most glorious tittie fuck,
cool green over the frame under the clothes line,
whos crew choose fuel most, mine,
holy trinity, tripple six, tripple x, city barrack,
glutton for punishment super size me while you at it,
built hideous,silk of the milk litigant, silly wicked finick he fidgit the middle digit ish,
will he alter what he feel is illy to pick at every little smidgen of integraty,
to the freight hot reaking of butter beans and harmonica,
dirty old man no tea cup thirsty, peak up skirts,
for slaps from that d-cup nurse,
cackle his old gums lewd , crass,
show the girl a trick like how he opens can food with the only tooth he has,
they dont call him anabolic ace for nothing, ok,
now current picture aside all anti-celebs remain aggro,
dead walk sturdy, but the day i greet the worms,
i pull the daisies down with me as a fuck you to the norms,
generic's so unappealing and in my humble opinion,
defeats a rappers civic duty to the culture,
granted every topic has been covered but cookie cutter,
delivery of simpleton wit is the real culprit,
so wether street, club, battle, conscious or other,
i find that interesting style can often out weigh the subject,
so when the disc changer goes from guns to space,
it is not an attempt to fake credibility for the public,
but fuck it it's ace rock six records of gibberish right?,
he's trying to hard to be weird and different right? ,
or could it possibly just maybe be, his lessons,
can't be summed up in a linear set of pop culture references?,
yeah but why try, i'm so groggy,
the mach nine valentine aint for everybody,
but i will say this to yall that used your fifteen of fame,
to mention my name, that sixteenth minute regret is fuckin insane,
and thats a longevity veteran pedelling free medicine,
who the fouler howler  who the rabble rouser,
what the happy hour starved the peruvian aggy powder,
trade up at the digital jesus factory outlet ,
bout it bout it, fuck a fork tongue cutlury, the fuckery is famous,
never wild shook but a slang that maybe alienated a couple strangers,
held a mongoloid fanbase that is alien by nature,
robot wars, machines hit the floor,
and the semians syncopated a gigantic "encore",
alright i'm bored, five minute bag of tricks,
if you hate me you can eat a bag of dicks, one
before shooting troops was cooler than hula hoops,
high noon was your basic who's who of brutal truth.
hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance
turn a young'n to a dozen paper dolls holding hands.
and tricky was a wooden horse pushed up on your porch
so chicanery was yours to engage or ignore.
i was on the latter but a lot adopt pawns,
so we carried lawn chairs and buckets of popcorn.
brawl fair, cop car, voyeur hawk him out his hinges,
storm door splinters, clamoring about, hammers out about to ring,
infiltrate each others tribes and murder each others queens.
packed to the very last rafter, clung to the rafts and the
cameras to capture the damage, neck swivel with a chomp chomp volley
where the ants leave nothing but the bones and the car keys.
pardon if his two feet fester.
it was rude of me people,
planted like a model of civility and honor for the sector
peace for the better but it wasn't entertaining,
so they waited for the tazing from the safety of his haven.
like bees to the honey when they lumped you up,
'cuz bumper cars are only funny when they bump.
hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- popcorn, popcorn
hot summer gun or box-cutter slow dance- capture the damage.
(yo, this dude talks real slow yo  crazy.
yeah man that's my boy steve; he just talks like that, it's weird.
tune to hellemundo for action packed blasphemy;
big city translate your face 'til it atrophies.
i let the schadenfreude boy out actually,
deployed to void with grin to watch laughingly.
pass the p's it's a laugh in,
i can smell the tragedy when hatchin',
alive with the menace of demise like yes! the pain dazzles men.
pass the popcorn, pass the popcorn it's reality at its fastest,
and yet it still unravels at a pace like molasses.
i guess the last of the seconds before the worst of disasters stretch past us,
wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?
in the corridors of entropous wars contort drastically tilted fits,
i adjust to climates of the wilderness,
walk along my spine take the pilgrimage,
up in to the section that's reserved for the smirk of the coldest witnesess,
there's all day to die, innovate the mayhem with grace,
the goodform-fall. fuck if i'm 'a warn y'all, nah
i got the front row to the greatest entertainment that an angel never saw.
sixty thousand watts of that raw pull the claw out of the trunk fun,
each one teach one how to club one,
look at how they bathe up in the dove blood,
it's gonna be a night of thrills and chills where the sacred is made of mud mud.
each one teach one how to club one- popcorn, popcorn
each one teach one how to club one- popcorn  wouldn't you agree that it is fabulous?
(yo honestly, if your man steve really talks like that  uh, that's not really normal
yeah, that sucks  yeah, it's pretty bad
nobody's voice should sound like that.)
it was a half-a-dozen claymores daisy-chained.
it wasn't daisies and crazy eights,
it was an ace of spades over a waiting game of slaves and saints.
and every trainee face-painted while his great escape grazed and ate,
he'll never make it, when he aims he shakes.
and i was overly engrossed from a very locked door
with a couple milk duds and buckets of popcorn.
monkey in the middle study how the bunker took the missiles.
age of machines with nary a green screens,
so the hecatomb is every bit as cutting as it seems.
i could tell the pet from the vet,
money where his canine's spread and never welched on a bet.
and you'll profit off his widow-maker's numbers every summer.
bump in the night, funny, will he catch and release 'em?
has he mercy? will he hack 'em to pieces?
is he dirty? will he hassle policemen
there is only skulls and bunnies
that hop around drunk in the land of a hundred mondays.
god damn, pop the redenbacher proper
and, for christ's sake, get this man a doctor.
i'm twice born, once and seven something
once is the resurrection of honorable function
been shoveling a coal as the engine's doctor
long enough to see my silhouette acquire a permanent kink in a posture
the metenance of icicle spirit by the warmth of true endearment
was, is, and forever will be a luxury
i'm a soubrette columnist fathering doom document
cursed version of a certain virgin mary womb occupant
i know swamp rats who never suckled oxygen purification
sure it's blurry may have had them speeennnd breeezzzzze
stuck until my friend leaves puppet for the plummet committee
sputtering bum numb enough to stomach the city
who's that hugging a silhouette of willows with a hill's crest pan out?
on the candy coated crab apples, sugar dipped deadpan outs
i got a plan, i'll turnaquet my quest
defeat a needle into battling to mute the mess
with patience galas with absentee balance i shove in the button
strutting to exhibit mankind's hostility function
with a, ppppppppp paling in comparison a methias goliath
live to riggedy frame in a wicked silence
i top and ate my nameless square then i bumped eyelids
with a christ we saw the same thing through a second
what's that? the grand mosaic depicting historical glory in a legend
nurse me through the time stick and stone mixes hex my fertile crescent
now all's well, i'm laughing on the inside i swear
just trying to keep my head above red tide despair
my imperfections pair off with buddy system symmetrics morbidly
so every second the discontent's locked accordingly
let's turn mummy's shut up affection a berserk glory condition
and pray for the day a star child tugs the ribbon
meddle in a two-hand grip when that spoon full of sugar medical chaser
credible crasser antidote's terrible taste the
water with a stolen soul pen left picture mad rhythm pinned
never set a grin and fly health
consider me a mobile advertisement for that hybrid plan of fabrics
i deemed practical, now is you is or is you ain't compatible
i feel a wind in my opinions plus hyper clutch
crush one's ginger bread tenement awful,
it's like the date of grado methasawmill
a lifeline of spectacular expansion leaves the reaper
at the hand of what man's hand jokes
my friend's got a book about dreams, i look and laugh
i dream a book about my friends and still can't decipher the half
ch-chatter boooox, now let a soothe sayer major
cater to a king green battered on the brink of disease
i am, skin and bones, i am, sin and poems, i am, tin and chrome
you grin and groans fuck it i'm tinted when accrete zone
blow the pedals off a dandelion trying to make my little gypsy blush
and felt as if i'd actually accomplish something
fortify the bullies of the jokes soaking in treatment
sit and watch the percentages teeter on the evening
on a ghost up in a fuse a lot second before the cock dropped
in the styx and stared him down until he fixed it
fashion, it's cool and all but what about god?
what, like novels, man that don't hold my attention, what about television?
i hate walking, it's boring, how about some old fashioned gone fishin'
i've got too left feet plus motion sickness, how about breakfast?
let's fly a kite
let's poke a hole inside the tugboat, ease on back and watch it sink
casually note the blossom of phantom alignment strategy
i'll make the waterfall out of order in autumn saw the quarter
when the gods mimic the vintage knuckle drag sacked in a coffin
i affiliate my rag dummy appearance with a most cohesive spirit
clattering the yesterday ain't shed a tear since
hear me, wrote the old yeller community cartoon
the carousel balloon extravagant aware, inviting it
i'm swore to adam and matter and saddling
warhead thorax and abdomen to primitive horse back galloping
my index fingers rest in my talisman branded up in the jackals skin
one must pardon yee old common street detour
weaving graceful through the prom directed column
greater virus retreats to a lot in valom
bean stalk where the fiend walk and my name is mud
but that's got a ring to it so my swill welcomes the flood
i walk through god's practical joke on man practically broke
and if they raise my rent again i'll spend my nights practically soaked
who spits silk dimensions with a noose looped by the raft?
after lack of reasoning jedi 3, 2, 1,
oooh i'm hung, i've clung to hope but see you in hell
i'll be that clear blue icicle that simply refused to melt
sturdy eye krulin, tin can skeleton,
skull of a thousand dilapidated dream remnants
here to convict based on a tin bucket of evidence
i steer where the heaven's merely a legend so the peasants dream well
four rooms, a ceiling and a floor but there's more
a desk with a subtle light, a window and a door
one bottle of the bluest inks your iris ever saw
one child prodigy with a vision in his core
i'm frost bitten, slippin' away titanic burden nurses
where the anti-hero clergy purge their value burning service
and warped was i huddled beneath the influenza fresh
meshed with impressions that appear to shrink before my very breath
these tides of woe and malice and mirth initiate a wave crash
splashing my offspring graves prior to birth it's looking bleak
malarky farce sergeant crooked and sleek emerald eyes glow
i'm shook in a freak side show
ok i strobe effects projective when i blink
so i resign this chorus line
when linked we let our eyelids fall and pilots stall
with what i sing i'll open lash light and dark clash to dim the wattage
then see the wide eyed dry grays and supplied fiery colossus
well i am a hostage guiding yet pushed beneath the crazes climate
hiding behind the levy while the stubborn rivers rise and feel this
i wish heavenly brevity centered hate pedigrees instead of dead serenity
god damn must have remembered me
it clinched me, it wrenched me, tempted me to employ it
apprehended me and rendered me suspended in its voyage
hand to the bottle with the skull and cross bones scribbled off the label
sip the ladle drank the burn begging for dead
concerns off with a zephyr tread and leg in a web
caught triple-six couriers beckon they fled
let 'em shake a little then release 'em
like as if ghostly hysterics would leash on banded completion
odium, patience ran his anti-death commando
just a litigant stretchin' to touch tranquil but couldn't quite catch the angle
i'm trained as corner stone famine troopers
so my tray within a heart of hearts still belly up and parched, come on
i'm a sideline observer alerted not yet retreating
the climate stubbornly hovered slightly above freezing
now everybody in the populis awaited my reply
i spit a billion tiny brilliant white lights into the sky
undeniably amused by the way the fuse burn
by the way the clues churn in front of my eyes
to fertilize germination of concern for me for we
for he who's sucked into the trench fully dug
i don't wanna pull the plug
hug on my canteen like in a dream
centipede leader speedin' through a meaty greed league
i can tell by the way the needs bleed from a seed
if the breed should have ever been bread 'nuff said
whether compared to caterpillar and cocoon
to emerge or a spark's soon a bloom to a surge
all i need is the nourishment, the courage and the burn
to ascend from a number to grave blade runner
more like i'm walking with a broken mood ring
mood swingin' from the mezzanine level
my team's settled on the ledge to pledge
in the summer it rains buckets of hunger pains
in the winter it's the same with an added climate change
the remaining two quadrants balance the polar values equally for midrange
yet the songs of thirst remain the same
you could turn the whole cold reservoir to liquor
hell, split the ocean on its seams if it boosts your esteem
i never lend span of attention lest my brethren signal fresh
so do your magic miracle worker i'll remain unimpressed
for the fact that little billy up the block obtained a lovely hand cannon
i'd examined auto pilot
concluded the few we're tuned with were now targets of his movement
it's intriguing, yet i guess i knew somewhere something was leaking
bring settler runaways frayed boogie bastard clicks
to bypass glass stature walking graph characters
militant dance split the sun and sip the filament
tracer, vivisection is to lab rat primes
they try to grace these sacred lips with his maze or a dirty wine
he knew, he brewed the substance just to mock the lesser budgets
then sought off all trickery bought off the public and screamed victory
tunnel through the mite infested grillage and the rig
as fast a aesop and his ten little fatigued fingers could dig trigger revenge
tip the goblet in the dirt review my words spit in the puddle
peace to faint struggle the fuck out and duck out
now, all hail defenders of the trash talk
i was hidden, yet i slid in just to rip the mask off
i'm seventy-six inches of all the purest sounds
so y'all could dig me six feet deep my eyes would still be over ground
there is a hole in front of the shovel, shovel in front of the brawn
six billion gorillas for whom the graves yawn
each withered his mule-ish days to choose his tool of trade
dueling blades that cue the cruel charade and fuel the flames
if you would clue the crew into the civil
just get the food and land like you the man who flew the coop over the pit-bulls
dash back flashy to compassionate nano police
sat beneath an avalanche and jagged and nautical seas
and i would stop the violence more than i was pontius pilate
cops and robbers riot by the vows of noxious sirens
a is gullible he figure all man equal no brainer
take it his friends and neighbors didn't cater
moms raised the babies through a very church-y eighties
sunday mornings reinforced the waiting gates of haties
and he brazen but apparently infernal bound now
for when a man had coughed recite his wrongs he wouldn't bow down
the punishment should fit the reasons you must punish him
never puncture skin or pull the colored rugs from under them
two opposing mother ships shall not employ the gunner's deck
cause brotherhoods of public good do not employ the unctuous in you
observing how the giveth is disproportionate to the taketh away decide to maketh his day
all the stoic odium glowing a coal holster
when he coulda stood easily in the tub juggling toasters
i pick the phone up with a grown-up mode approach
skin crawlin off the drawl and now it clawed the awkward tone up
i'd known it wasn't roses but hoped it was less corrosive
coast in to the focus of the grossest diagnosis like
holmes, the barnicles that chew upon the flesh of man
have clued into suitor's capital to a beggars hand
comfortably, sung a stubborn legacy of gluttony
with carnivores that burrow like hunters into the blood and meat
the chinny chin up and the city picked her sinning pen up let her numb the spitting stigma
along came a spider sold her eggs to any buyer
now the shooter in back is six legs wider than the driver
if you make no friends on the way to the top rung
there is no secret handshake club i do not give a fuck
but know the cancers make the olive branches obviously standard
so when they extend from the yachts and mansions drop your cannons
all kings hang em for the cliff side drip dry
will he clip to zip line or slip for his final dip dive
if he live, will he survive the milligrams of middle ground
they pump into the pinstripe pentagrams over tinsel town
or kill a man who trickled down the city with his scissors out as sickles
dipped in military hells bells and whistles
thank you for the peace on earth and mercy miled high
flash that buttery gold, jittery zeitgeist
wither by the watering hole, water patrol
what are we, to heart huckabee, art fuckery suddenly?
not enough young in his lung for the water wings?
colorfully vulgar poacher at a mulch like
'i'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt'
sign of the time we elapsed
when a primate climb up a spine and attach
eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
they get a rise out of frogs and flies
so when a dog fights hog-tied prize sorta costs a life
the mouths water on a fork and knife
it's gore on a war-torn beach
where the cash cows actually beef
blood turns wine when i leak for police
like 'that's not a riot, it's a feast, let's eat'
and i will remember your name and face
on the day you were judged by the fun house cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like 'none shall pass'
now if he never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
he wouldn't relate to the rouge vocoder bliss
how he spoke through a no-doz, motor on the fritz
'cause he wouldn't play roll over, fetch, like a bitch
and express no regrets though he isn't worth the homeowners piss
to the jokers who pose by the glitz
sign of the swine and the swarm
when a king is a whore who comply and conform
miles outside of the eye of the storm
with a siphon to lure and a prize and award
while avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
like wait, let it snake up outta the centerfold
let it break the walls of jericho. ready? go
sat where the old cardboard city folks
swap tails with heads like every other penny throw
and i will remember your name and face
on the day you were judged by the fun house cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like 'none shall pass'
okay, woke to a grocery list
duty and death
anyone object, come stand in the way
you can be my little snake river canyon today
and i ran with a chain of commands
and a jet pack strap where the back stab lands if it can
sign of the vibe in the crowd
when i cut a belly open to find what climb out
what a bit of gusto he muster up
make a dark horse rush like enoughs enough
it must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
till all the king's men fluster and cluster fuck
to my people who keep an impressive wing span
you gotta pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
and i will remember your name and face
on the day you were judged by the fun house cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like 'none shall pass'
"do you know what 'nemesis' means?
personified in this case by me"
we're all in the same gang, bread and butter
just a couple subdivisions who naturally hate each other
influence is shark biting the fuck outta your brother
friendship is professor plum ratting on colonel mustard
you are now witnessing the world's most crass version
of a barnstormer, reveal time with a jagged edge
arm mortars and field mines for a bastard pledge
swung before that magnificent havok sketch
you fidget like a nervous culprit gulpin'
sweat a bullet, dead a bullshit sequence reactor
who leaps off the canvas to provoke a side winder
snake in the grass with a dirty belly and his work to sell me
i got my word to tell you
but it works like pistons pumping through the realm my family habits
nah, more like i'm spitting pixy dust
till the mix taper community combusts
not to mention praise for their release on a page
it might evade the light of day
i never said i gave them all the fight to be brave
whose ads have been paid for by some brothers
while some of us lie in the eyes of others
i discovered another way to stay undercover
this to me is how to leave matters resolved
out of this all, you should take a break, ask the fake
get snatched out your habitat and left on the side of a lake
whether a clean getaway is harder to make
than a call to the cleaners
zipped up with enough cash to pay the cat
god is a name i call myself
i don't like ugly, original, synthetic
it becomes the lung, the mind is a closet
that is if it's a walk-in, 'cause i'm open
you fell from the cliffs of weakness, i scoped it
i'll ball your rhyme up and stuff it inside my mouth
as if this was the first grade
and your teeth'll grind 'cause you rhyme first grade
see in this life timetime i'm a caged poet
but i think life is more than a jail sentence
that's why i took my time
doing calisthenics which euphemisms to hand out a life sentence
when i rhyme i put my ass crack in it
and you in a glass bottom boat with a crack in it
my poetry's position is the sole definition of latitude
"you tell the angels in heaven you've never seen
an evil so singularly personified as you being hit
in the face by the man who killed you"
this be the dawning of the age of dead water
somebody live enough to bust through the belly with a fist up
this is a right now generation murdered by the fan base
this is adored by the writers-dead water
formed by the village of badness and bad karma
punched by the stagnant water gate threw the fickle back
but by the window's still three nickels in a piggy bank
caught her with her head up funny stomach from the hunger pains
flashed automatic b-boy with big visions
in a matchbox apartment adjacent a crooked starship
who better nation a million's the only remedy
nine dizzy planets with a bullet riding centerpiece
i'm bout as sick of burning find the hottest slacker in a visionary costume
warm for a second to the minute he whored herself to disaster
i recognize the cankers by the mechanical stagger
as opposed to the skip of big brother bad slapper
theologies who need to keep the cookies caffeinated
like a mad hatter that'll sleep now, ask after
calibrate the happy scale when he's soakin
wet with a mouthful of dead ideas and see if it tipped zero
stripped ego, tall stories of broad glory
i'll be god while you're still living life on a full 40
or maybe i'll be gramacin, homes poor, broke and lonely
hidden by my billygoat beard and cardboard monstrosity
i drink a bad glass of gumption
not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning disgusting
wildchild activater activate sludge enough to dungeon for a accolade and wild ones
i committed wild murder, went through the city
with a wild merger, woke up in a wildstyle burner
space case, boom box, hate tapes, no lemonade breaks , no cheddar in labor days
right now, im here to break a point of big system plus my screen
i was never cursed in a russmeyer bixon
spit sob stories to confront my dick addictions
of the dirty basement at the graves of salem witches
driving my stake through the face of painstaking business
but i scream misery
out of sleep, lifted up lobotomy, little jackie paper
and a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery
i'll be the ugliest version of paranoia
kingpin set in motion by the secondhand pressure
some get excited when the sun folds under
some get excited when the summer hits the pavement
some get excited when the bullet hits bone and a board
i'll escape through the train yard and sleep till it's broken
this be the settling of debt of warm water
somebody mad enough to cut apart the curtain with a fist up
this is the dagger in the 88 magnificent memorial
this is the heater to a movement-dead water
when i broke fifth and got sparks
january, i fell to the cobblestone
in april, i cut little paper flowers
in august, i drank cold tea all my lonesome
in october, i was introduced to scourers
and since i plan to live a long life
maybe i'll serve a thousand mondays and swallow the burn
to merge the week for all its got
to get my shoddy rotten ribs stick, forgot my ribs
i got a lil' something called a spirit crisis on my skull
and it's nothing short of ferocious but i swallowed the dosage
i got a mantle, and the mantle is a candle
and my candle is a flame that burns to symbolize the day gretel met hansel
then i settle in a stand still
i live forever reaching for the sun
hoping some lucky day i'll clutch and get a hand full
rope ladder, i'm a swinging anvil
and i wanna turn scullies and summings with pretty lullabye, bye
the way my gypsy dances makes a monster retreat to fetal
i never felt so damn young
but you don't look a day over zero
and you don't look a day in the times 'cause it'll make you realize
well then go, dream, i clean around the edges
i tidy up the tabletop, and lectured all the pledges
i never really knew the true definition of precious
till my angel wit the beautiful red locks gave me the message
i'm a fully animated life tree
see the root of the mute button was dug up bug up on a song
of i'm a fully animated life tree
with branches for the heavens to admire actually
fame, war, love, honor, crime, innocence, tragedy, sunshine
cringe, death, passion, heroism, god, suffering, joy, fate
destiny, treasure, stars, gall, hunger, murder, silence, mayhem
health, pain, suspense, breath, sound, guilt, pride, time
we all know what a halo is
but we all don't know the horrors if your halo tips
i be the matador making your pretty little heels click
i be the sword in the stone of the contemporary eclipse
you can't imagine, got my warm spirit stuck in my teeth, i'm obsolete
better stay competitive, meter in such to bust, fuckin fantastic
every little steps you take breaks the tangles
in the chest, developed in the abomidable trouble
settle for a cruel second, loud for an hour
screamin to the beats to leave until my whole weekend turns sour
i ain't been around the world but i been around the block
i ain't seen everything but i seen enough to talk
i ain't a prophet, i ain't the second coming of christ
i'm just a mason with a will to build and a little advice
i wanna weave a web, i wanna set of knitting needles
villain with a theme dream silent
paddle in the hole divy to where the portraits astonish
you won't regret a single solitary step, i promise
look, in a situation where a dragon guards the gate
i make a true spur of the moment grown decision
which in turn allows me to be something normal
i can kill every monster if i gotta, that's that
be the little guinea pig, dig?
i'm tryin to make an exit with no ripples in the water
no splash, let the poison slide down down the hatch
every little step we take breaks the dreams
of a warm pig itching to re-stitch the seams
namsayin, when i walk, i want to break concrete!
ox'll spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror
my light beams are mad bright,
found your body in the desert
yeah yeah i rap tight like saran
plus enter battles talkin' shit like
i'm tired of cats tryin' to sum me
you can't add that far yet,
to see if they bite when they catch
i told you my poetry sponsors gillette
wit razors in your head like barrettes
man, if the mic had ass cheeks
and man, i dunno if it was me or you
but your girl was on my dick like she was teethin'
i'll play the poppy seed on top of you
that doesn't mean i act usual
one of the first emcees to give
'cause you need love and affection
if we could absorb every star in the sky
we noticed some shine brighter than others,
it's the simple things in life
that turn the peasants into leaders
and we know the differences between
if we could absorb every star in the sky
we noticed some shine brighter than others,
it's the simple things in life
that turn the peasants into leaders
and we know the differences between
itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet
i hold a book of matches captive to flashin'
my little limbs lassoed catered to wings
i know a crossbreed strung well in the key of
but never supply and demand it
to hell wit plastic, ooh yeah it's splendid
lend it to the devil of a friend it,
now every toy dreams to manufacture hearts
start with the diving parts and the blueprints
set by war pigs of a yesteryear
skip a stone over the reservoir
hmm gun play the tumors platoon
i fell asleep holding an appleseed,
the only bridge i ever burned
the cities of prosperity and chance
if we could absorb every star in the sky
we noticed some shine brighter than others,
it's the simple things in life
that turn the peasants into leaders
and we know the differences between

they've got angels sweatin' like helots
workin' their little halos to the bone combing them deserts
the way my schoolin' end-less-ly defined every day
one exquisite fitted crisis rivets an octagon of red
to the ceiling above my bed
it's not a conversation piece, like public spectacles
so when i wake up to the rains i'll be one step ahead of you
wrote a poem for every planet
tracked their mileage from the sun in an envelope
got eight thank yous in the mail, but nine planets means there's one left
only the earth would thank me later with a breath taking sunset
zip that waterfall around your skeleton
dig it, i split my lip kissing the winter
strung a hammock between spring and where the willows turn to blood
sip a little, litter it, love it
without big beetles trying to sell him sunflower seeds by the bucket
might of, tugboat for the boxcutter above those ashes
without hot air balloons floatin' their four passenger baskets
to let a captive lacerate a caption
apolster plastic glasses with famine patches
i-dentify all saints linked around the fountain's warmth
and for a second taste of pain when removing that crown of thorns
?????,???,???, born hostile, pacifist huddled in subtle masochist
my fire escape overlooks ghost town market place
then fast themselves to the target's face
if i had a hammer, i'd build a city on stilts
so my feet would stay dry when god's wine glass tilts
if i had a shovel, i'd dig a hole in the dirt
and i'll be hiding when his drunken stupor lands upon earth
and if your little wing is broken
i'll see the poacher in hell
i can't afford another ????? in a cell
my carousel mimics the interests of a thousand leaking spickets
and a colony of graziers raised to justify the grimace
i prescribe the remedy plus the premises
my pin cushion, my limbs pushin' the knitting needle
evils, idle, peddle past the greeting
stop, watch the eagles board the little engine that could not
and it fell in my lap
passin', postin' the bail but the guard has misplaced the key ring (that's
i lead a flee to blaze exact songs directly into the village
power supply burning the bridge between the magnet and my eye
now how many cadavers satisfy a mad man?
and how many crooked samaritans turn plesantville to bad land?
i can count my own dusty nickels with you laughing
about you'll turn my poor ass ebony and navy with cane lashings
grip your pointed stick, incite your riot
i'll sell your worth in a bottle at profit, explain my bias
atomic box cult, downward spiral rapidly
cast to hell with hate mail, forged christ's autograph
mummified well inside a muddy new york minute
your remnants my smoke rings have cocooned prior to fading?
well, it wasn't conscious spite but it might have been that
i am not your friend anymore
when narrow bed sleepers occupy the basement
and i am not your friend anymore
come the dawning of cerulean your pity blend that whispers in the wind
man, if it were only that simple
i'd add a guilt frame to my core
i'd board myself inside my room to trace the wilting contour
one petal falls to the rug, she loves me not
town crier lugging a boom box with spirit plugs
tied to irony like twenty burning igloos with a sailors knot
fiddler crabs build sandcastles while high tide off azalea crops
in the icicle field i portray, cats get antsy
and ask 'why if every light is dark do i continue dancing?'
why if every light is dark do i continue dancing?
why if every light is dark do i continue dancing?
why if every light is dark do i continue dancing?
well if it ain't finally a question that's worth answering
for the comic book in my heart
for the mark emerging across the street selling me stog's at half price
for the mights, the maybes, the nauseating pitfall
for the fact my window opens towards a brick wall
for the three legged dog i saw dragged on a leash
for the homeless man who walks my block in rainstorms with plastic bags on
see i throw away the tenders over one shoulder
through every wicked world to kiss tomorrow's morning
you'll drown in a pool of your crooked morals
whispering 'maybe aesop rock was on to something'
you replicas overlooking the guidelines of acoustics
paragon pen dragon tactician on freeform
then a comfortable silence try to combat cliques
worked up you're shooken, jetted to the side
i stagger this vagabond wondering menstrual forms of phobia
worst fear the terrace stricken muted
the roots of all evil i've rooted pinnacle
poised with pride pouncing to break your stride, forsaken
agony rides inside the heartache wretched condition
my intuition felt you slip up
you tripped alone what are you aiming for?
or do you sus tries to classify your genus, distorted fetus
evolve, type unsolved, you lack the malediction
malleable martyrs get molded, then folded under pressure
bridge over troubled water drown, sound study intensive
my square drops two erasing lines like tetris
relentless agent hush horrendous circles on my pavement
two sticks to burn basics the lie adjacent to my placement
on the game board, lunge forward and wind-up impaled by the same sword
choose your weapon, stains splattered upon your flag
stall face to face with a forms that force your downfall
admittedly suspicious, a decadence, your network's on hiatus
permanent, provoked and choked upon the potency
the parrow be the penetrating agent pierce the insides
why the cold sweats at midnight? why the dim light?
why are we staring at a true from the inside?
why the pen slide with vigor on a put down?
like while i put my foot down stomp your city
a-e-s-o-p scoping through the bur, opening minds behind the smirks
i've seen misery, i've seen disgust dust ridden ruins
iron clad oracle test three com unit disperse silently
plot twist full hardy icarus shifted in facets of my form
forbidden aspects of the swarm a thorn upon your side
a storm upon the rise, adam, i or crush come brush upon the red zone
crook you're shook you started poorly
your powers parted pace uncharted territory
disoriented malicious god you'll burn your bridges
graphs, gritted blueprints of nemesis perimeter
hunting by night compute, twenty one mic salute
one life polluted, concerned muffle moans
from the nine rings of donnie's hell burn you in your slumber
whipping through the willows is the warden of this garden
slipping through the silhouetted skylines aesop sidewinds jaded
don't wind up war painted into the jungle the solution's not intrusion
the starving institution broke your main frame
i pose the question, are these waiting games worth it or worthless?
while i comb the crowd for clues your nyebony hands be my purpose
our planet is the pivotal point
in which this network slowly turns to filter kicks
we out-box the berserk bewildered by the wilderness
my clench is frantic clutch manners falling through underbrush
touch fools that duel with a dominant
the evil-minded tried to triple six me but he missed me
intervene; emcees appear as red blips on my color radar screen
notice how the phobias appropriately procreate
woke up with a ghost farm focused on his groceries
when they arent telling stories they are multiplying grossly
the aberrations have been drinking this water for too long
so when they gather by the bird bath in the morning he will tell 'em
i mean no disrespect, but you have all outstayed your welcome
interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence
how quickly they will lift their heads
and breathe an ultimatum like the dead dont argue
set your living by the bayonet, but how alive are you?
shit, a is all juice and bad etiquette
elbows on the table, lobster bibbin' on the ready
i dont know homey, you decide
and one by one around the yard til each one felt communal pride
like they had done a little part in cleaning up the public
with a steaming plate of justice for them easy baker stomachs
we the legends that home with the unremembered
geriatric lore in the clutch of the budding censor
who snuck around the art police and all related governments
to infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip
ah moneys in the market for a mother-ship
double as a vessel that drag its legacy under it
and who am i to hang them out to dry by the heap?
when if rehydrating fails, were all dumber because of me
zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly
the too alive channel from the library of rivalry
i got a handful rocking the same poker face
down to dance around the table like they own the place
i got the whole world thinking its a holiday
cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away
i traded my title as bent pedestrian for passenger status to coast muted
finding the night train mildly therapeutic
rugged hacker flashing mood full of swings
beneath this puppet master pulling my strings
leaking smoke rings singing [your despite what measured honestly
syndicate sold to children building homes for my omnipotent platoons
nah i don't think the blueprints drafted tilted in the tombs
tampering hampered scampered well beyond the dooms
we bloomed? the matter down to those most beautifully discrete
applying yesterdays models stand obsolete amongst colossals [amongst
comply not to enforce us aborted claiming they came off
sort of stabbed them with the capital 'a' that sets my name off
sick of the thick brick in the wall sob stories the falls the tragic hate
shaking like magic eight balls pausing to watch the vapors crawl
my clique heeds lessons i'll be noted from kids sisters paper dolls
we lining up along against these great walls
rhetorical inquiries yet x is not applicable kid
?
you talk the concrete examples with glass bottoms cause defeated kid i'm
its flight of the intruder and we all fall down
conditions of never blends science with religion
cut my character cleansed in esoteric opulence
but finding no intrinsic merit in your sense
drunken distortion and spit the filter in
mic sweltering measures like melting my rings together an you never
seen i aesop rock flop for the love of eighty-nine point nine
i'm here to ride upon the night train
[yeah wkcr 89.9 . . . here for the night train . . . whats up to my man
apex, kinetic, dj ely, baz, my man dub el on productions, the mighty ger, my
man patrick, blockhead, mr roper, omega one, my man hates one, percy p
andre . . . stay up .   its like that . . . its big aesop rock signing off
take take, the medicine tastes great
gotta keep in the city i'm way baked
waiting for the meteor shading at twelve begin paint
the origin of a deeper leader will take place
two coke bottles adorn the rope toddler
no role model, provoke him to shift focus
cus he noticed that a cookie tastes better when it's stolen
all ?? get from an honest person
bought enough fireworks from the bullies to blow up a small barn
which he kept in the box in the yard
and the bark is far from a klepto-anthem
stand up, celebrate the natural need to own what ain't earned
see it rolls off the tongue
like a smoke ring rolls off a lung til it's done
later applied the motives to a moment of some grown shit
"hey, you with the sharpie and bm!"
well the freedom will correlate with the sword play and heathens
of the modern bright slide rule
every last number in it's history
got it's own little hustle to nuzzle up with the victory, thanks
bathe in a bottle of your finest
huckleberry sift through the piss looking for diamonds
for that hell appears to that in your climate
get your money from the richest seek your pussy from the flyest
slow and low, do or die calm
suicide king and a tuck of the palm
slow and low, do or die, stuck
two to five cans in the trunk of the truck
and these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
one by one like little confused penguins
larceny's yes when fools used weapons
like a bitter little burgular jaded up at the buckets
he's dumb enough to pull up in public in the fuckin thing
nope gotta configure the five fingers
sorta hop wire vehicular skill is applicable
if an eye's on the prize and the itch aint flushed
i hope the fruits of your labor relieve the initial rush
like, step over the abysmal cusp
matchmakers trying to make the mixed signals fucked
and make you read the mud, maybe make the stigma's crushed
like "he will learn to walk after he lifts the drums"
and this is certified milk by the department of skullduggery
shoplift quicker than ya shutter speed
in another muddy river water til the rudder bleeds
skip around the money peel the color me bunny killer
let a crumby motherfucker breed fuck wit me
it goes knock knock, rummy at an abrupt speed
the seed's all growns up, playing grown people games
evil lames grown encompass the whole paper chase
grip, better get the master plan
so when the workers of a secret graph expands,
yes a pig is a cop, i got a villian for flock, so when i rake in the bacon i hope the kiddies will watch
i hope the flipping of the system will be heavily clocked
cus opportunity's fickle if they we're trickling stop!
drag that crass little bastard flap through the hazmat glass
laugh when he asks for it back
welcome to the magic and a basket of cash
slow and low,do or die, calm
suicide king and a tuck of the palm
slow and low, do or die, stuck
two to five cans in the trunk of the truck
and these are the five fingers that are stealing from you
this fallen angel could stitch a wing with a shoestring
the prime directive selects reflective aviation
i'm broke, i know a walking corpse who'd spit icicle dagger
quicker than you can prove there's four letters in hope
i paint a portrait from my cell called life
orbiting hell's orchard intrigued but not compelled
i smell a hint of charred child flesh sweeping through my quarters
order one canteen of liquid caffeine and eclipse the slaughter
now is you is the villain of my kabuki hologram
cuz i hobble with hollow hands
we see intent to re-invent dream application
but honor modern replacements circling now basics
i'm bilbo baggins with stilts tipping the petri dish
beached fish on the shores where the feast of wits eat the corpse
divvy the servings and study the traits that deemed
that's a harp of a different color but the song remains identical
i am not a crook, i cook the wick at both ends
just to blend that element of chance with my tight rope dance
life, sight beyond, fire ant with a hunger pain gut be gone
belong to something civil, saint, cuz this rembrandt paints on
and it's a cold canvas lodged in the gut of atlantis
some truly learn what a death chant is
i alone personify mankind's collective sulk
as a result of one angry zeus fist blistering cult pulp in bulk
face it, die, place it on the shelf
next to the portrait mommy gave you
of the day it rained but y'all posed by the slave ship anyway
make it rain 'til the levy breaks
my fetus breeds as a combine of father time
and it saddens me like televised casualties
i'll be hung in the village square in exactly 5 minutes
you don't want to miss it
as a token of my discontent regarding the equation
i float, while everyone around me's busy drowning
yo, i surf an axiom kicked in a center fold by ugly tenements
oh distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby development
today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate.
tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it.
there is a brain in the thicket tap circle cupping the port to accord it
teeter thorn storm plunges more but conformers the pouring's half the entry
plated pearly gates a chanted axis with high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing squirming in terms in conditions of un-sati fact destiny magnet
where the ebony should of cracked shit ratio tragic
lose sight suit oh mavericks clash at futility pageants
i post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion
a leader's deception connection wiper with a barn responds his friend
with an eye socket full of needles and a will to die for nothing
and that's glory abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats
and the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath
all aboard that awful train through shames patch where i'd trade my window seat for one pane of replacement stain glass, see i've battled the gods of opacity
i don't mind yall looking in, its just watching sim city steam slips under my skin
and im about half way to nausea, half way to contempt men
2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment
build a pen around master dome patriarch close to four peters
woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious
let's soak my feet in lake infinity the time vibe strapped to dignity my symmetries vivid image still cant mimic the victory comfort is a crumb and i'm numb as fuck
yet some prefer the hum and others tend to suck the life out of the crux like
1,2,3,4 and im a hug dummy hug the hungry pull the lever push the button
drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest target everyone
beckon eyes idols that have a malleable colony till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf grief your dreams a needle in a needle stack claiming safety pin physics
baby tin blizzards collide while ole iron sides trust the rivets
i'm sick of the picker the litter soaking the spot lit when i know they know they owe all thanks to the end all aesop rock shit watch this
build me a home; build me a home of brick and wood and everything good
with a front porch where i can char fire flies by night and smoke stogs till the day meets twilight, build me a home, build me a home with a green grass hill with runing a water in a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers build me a home with a basement and an attic where i can store remnants of the day i once slept in build me a home.
no skull is sacred in the races
locked in a pagan doctrine watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant
oak currents the end of war paintings stain plague community harking as wrapped
it's overlooking out crops. give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss on the least common attachment 10 seconds of glittering silence pilot is flight redefine stagnant
most emotions host an entire lesson congressional less one stone merely for the exceptional spectacle now listen the pause heed tall falls the voidance of the suit dispersed await a straightened arrows a perfect circle has been fastened to the blimp side buy in my grin and clusters that's better than colony my own fathers son is the holy ghost suck that theology i king for a day of peasant for a pleasant life blood on the easel and my eagle eyelids spots runaway pirates look i despise squatters with a ohh cry me a river a quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue i put my hook in the pond i put my worm in the hook i put my trust in the worm that he'd bring me something to cook
i felt a tug on my line and i lugged a trash can on my pole with a note from the worm attached that read thanks for nothing asshole simple parables of nature making character giddy and riddle me a similar situation mix city quick but your honorable a lot doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and report on powers of devil treatment church links im a fence sitter lips torn by both polars and their working i can only model throttle at the dream catching matching a patchy holist with a sovereignty harbored and charged my hate breed in a minute he's picket spitting stitches to fix the britches in the gaps one night i broke in bridges give us traps and tried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps and im, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath
making that classic mockery of every step oh build me a home, build me a home please with a light in the window and a red front door and a picket fence and a fire place and a sturdy frame and we can sit i'll tell you my name build me home.
and see it like it is baby
yo, i was thinking about my sick friend
stringing a ring around my wits end
13 loops later his feet hung inches out the pig pen
motley day goblins brought him pillage to pass the stillness
with bad javelin tip dipped inside, barreled, black magic brilliance
who rose at the tomb of the 'unknown soldier'?
to capture the fascist fragment choreographed
looked like sickle cells to the principles of pi rotary
one hope distortion odyssey sputters itself
to my how not example sample
give me the bread crust while considering the littering
i dont pity the head rush or the whimpering, spill
anchor to rock bottom, rocks bottom packs a ravenous catalyst
sprung arachnid, leashed by the carnal tyrant
i choked when the cage bird sings it stings
springs me out delirium to stitch them clipped wings
i sink instinctively brinked while they're clinging the shrieking souls
mourning the death of fallen ideologues to quality control
quality control, stand still string up the banner
from the beehive to the anthill, rag dummy
incorporate the unison of vikings ship throwers plus the perfection
of the twice to burn with half the stone throwers
my communicative hindrance pleads the needs
of a billion hungry victims gripped by the hell
thats slipped to splinters and got
shivving up the mass of natives and its league marvels
one components sure to shock a mass burial, breeze
broken penny bank fragments float up at stagnant seas
dirty work plus applicants with chatter box disease
iron bandit, give them the stars, the head balloons and rubies
asked for many moons and i cant stand it any more
this is how i feel that i sling
and the regulars were so amazed
i'm the mightiest slinger of them all
there is a time for war and a time for peace
and a time to run and a time to split
i dont run a funny race, malnourished monarchs and loopy admirals
where 99.9 per cent swear by their broken axles
i built boats of a pack rat bats of bully club swung
post utility inhalants nail it to stability and sail it
lopsided star bird bow crooked mass makeshift
patching holes with chewing gum and stitching sail to thirsty faces
observe me sitting with my eyes tied to the clock
cause i know that once that wind kicks up you
and your motors left roped to the dock
and its the, art of clarity married to slender extension
of blue sky of a happy neighborhood
string on my ring has left me dancing
like wooden dummies in a paper nature
merry etiquette's a door nail, friends is little brittle dolls of paper
in assembly, i tremble with a crocodile smile
hiding a fish out of water complex provided upon entry
now if i, were to, hold to speed
to levigate the game plan, would you honestly impede
i mean i guess, i can just divorce me from the rest
and blame my chemical imbalance for the fact ive made a mess
but my loyalty supply hints on which  i should run with
and im thinking that damn town priors about to fill this here bucket
its that, grand precious that precious that part of you wants to touch
and part of you just wants to sit and be impressed with
tainted agony induct in barnacle attachments
mood swinging upon the barnstorm to perpendicular traffic
spread, circle 4,000 circuits you burn to cater wings
above alkadiene townsman spoon-fed the shadow
im tired of being wired into the thief ratio
its gnawing a hole through my scheme so i leave
it is the molotov cocktail hour
have i not brought you blessings without number?
and nothing is plenty for them
yeah, i've never had it so good
so you want to be a carpenter, do you?
well it takes more than a hammer, boy
you're gonna need blueprints and a will to build
and straighten your cap, you look like you've been through a war
wipe that grin off your mug, you got a sturdy frame?
sluggish posture just won't cut it
you're gonna need schooling, and, and, and take notes
and god if i catch you yawning again
you're gonna regret ever asking for my help
and dammit you gotta hustle, this is a slacker free zone
and, where's my pencil? go get your hard hat
here's a nickel, go get us a ruler and a saw
and a drill and lots of graph paper
yo, i used to have a rope ladder but tattered were the rungs
i strung it from the highest willow, trying to hug the sun
the seventh level buckled and i tumbled from the summit
now i'm back to re climb and this time light my cigarette from it
my stitchin' division to vision warfares numb
enough to soak suddenly in a bullet bath and skip stones in the morning
as i, lie in color phantom tantrum explicable
sit and pull the petals off wild flower patches, magic happens
doom city barracks left remorse coursed
on a horse drawn carriage by the torch of polaris
to the badlands, where every bridge collapse
where the witches are fireproof and every preacher's a madman
frigid be the appleseed demeanor towards the bay
where the land shark parliament swims
when they pause to polish they fins
the better brains will preach the village through the city square
to the light, heavy and middle-weight integrate
slept with sticks and stones in my pillowcase
oohmy bomb's light simulator picks barnacles off the tugboat belly
left my spirit home in a shoebox in case i die
got a rugged smoke green halo floatin' inches off the swamp
had that phase when the devil tree contacts a sparkle in my eye
now step back from the reservoir and let the settlers drink
salvage all priorities and iron out all kinks
my house ain't made of bricks and straw but never has it crumbled
'cuz i stitched the brain's rigidity with symmetry
now here's how its done, i'm only gonna show you once
so pay close attention, hear me now or hear me never
glue your little eyes to the diagram
see the plywood, the nails, the glue? you work every inch
your domain and you must treat it well
keep it clean or it'll swallow you whole
where's the t square, hand me the pliers
now dammit, oh this will never do
you have to want the castle, head up, shoulders back
be the materials, know your limits only to break your limits
are you listening? god dammit boy, pay attention
try it again, little bit more juice this time
try it again, yeah a little bit more elbow grease this time
try it again, concentrate, a little more focus this time
you can kick and scream and yell but damn i'm only tryin' to help
try it again, you're not doing it right, here now, ya'll watch
try it again, stop sulking, i'm the example, for real, watch
try it again, i'm bout to make it easy for you yall, just watch
you can kick and scream and yell but damn i'm only tryin' to help
the hunt dispatched a pack of wild dog silhouettes
all sulking by the skyline, focused with a bonus hunger pain
from a vintage grimace slap to the mug of
ancestral branch camped on the vessels
yes and i abide, the laws of the hidden desert survived
and every peasant presented it on the crescent less deprived
with the exception of pleasant finale binges
on the great endangered interests of phantom brigades
i double the negative, to no avail, no promised benefits
just delegates peddling pairs of negatives
with magnified magnanimous appearance sandy sinners in opinion shut
now what of the madness fragments? stagnant
i oughta make a vision sing my twix cling to your pigeon wings
vision militia indent benders , we've flooded hell's kitchen sink
walkin' eye civility simpleton citizen mixers to kiss the sky in unison
sinister city blistered corporate rule igans
all i really want's a nickel to feed my little pigs
big dick three cheers to the product
consumer populace feed but never dreamed of the process
when a slanted advantage point sort of makeshift criminals
dream away the blame pain, yeah but it seeps through the cracks
and drips from the ceiling and smells the rich scent of my tracks
all i ever really wanted was a jungle, and a jungle i got
see it ain't the vision it's the plot that makes me stop
try it again, i don't want to
i stood before the glittery borders of new radius in search of the fabled city of mud and crushed velvet, what i found was a gutter where the love of entertainment meets the lust for blood and demerits, cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky, collar pop jolly roger, die motherfucker die, apache on the ship shape and bristol fashion snuck a jammy through the red tape and tip toe past him. worm teeth grinding feverishly below, as little organic hacksaws eager to feed and grow, so when it's blackhawk over the glass walk, they surface up through the cash crops with clippers for your belly-up mascots, and never dine alone, meanwhile back at sea level it was home by home zone for zone, bloom county's homeless riot for home ownership, i hope you put gas in the motor-home and know the roads, i studied with the finest combs stuck under my thumb as opposed to the loaded nose who pray armageddon is numb and that's unevenly rendered to those who grew up thinking faith was the surrender of reason but not a reason to surrender. catch the liberty fires catalog, 40 torched orchids and citronella for algernon, don and vagabond alike repent, this shit should have gone "beta burns babylon, the end".
and when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors to murder the medium that shot 'em 30 years before they said
and when the cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky, no love lost baby the future is so bright
nothing says charm like an armored car taking the clone-farm 'tards to the arms bizarre, we were the homemade marker makers born to pour the marsh ink into right guard parts and march through the gauntlet of car alarms, no harps, no delusions of losing with something prettier than ash around the metacarpal still clutching the teddy bears, we can run with scissors through the city fair or situate the nuzzle with the subtle art of splitting hairs, double park the shuttle, some will arc the funneled cutty sark where budding narcs target the gushing heart in the muddy clarks, these are the vices of the p-noid bastards who will chew whatever tablets blur the axioms fastest, crews lose lunches by the hundreds, lose electricity, lose gas, phone, plumbing, humming keep your mouth closed, keep your cows cloned, go, i am the pulse of this fucking town, homes, no. my what a convenient embargo, at least i'll always know which side of the gun i'm supposed to buy the farm from, the too-far-gone kicks still in the box, fix still in the pill in his sock ,chilling, gill in the slop, and a million watch gideon scribes, but once the arc honor pussy and bribes, the animals will divide and that's a win for the garish who keep charity in the parish while profiting off the lack of a marriage amongst the classes.
and when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors to murder the medium that shot 'em 30 years before they said
and when the cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky, no love lost baby the future is so bright
the mobile infantry is so postal, coast into the quotient provoking the local pistol pete, choking his liberty and justice quotas and cloaking his folk in smithereens, smokey little pile of bloody pulp and co-dependencies. dopey no surrender bender in effect, sole defenders of the longest night new york had never slept, and there were jumping jacks and whistlers over christmas, like rockets from the crypt spilling the festive morning beverage of your preference, i step in hog heaven, stoney with no weapons, pissing on teleprompters, selling megaphones to hecklers, who broadcast 80 million versions of the sermon for that one indisputable masterpiece before the curtains, pale arcadian moon, high definition flat plasma, imax city-wide transfer, artificial einstein-rosen out the tenement, ease into the xanadu, let it hammer the tension out, i'm talking cool, calm, dominant phenomenal, monitor face to the wall opposite. u.f.o.'s and locusts sing the same old song while the weathermen get retarded as the day is long
and when the radio stars climbed up out of the floors to murder the medium that shot 'em 30 years before they said
and when the cutters of the pie throw your summers in the sky, no love lost baby the future is so bright
killings reflect the destiny of the village
so when 20 count regrets float down futility spillage
see i'll pass the broken arrow this time for certain
yea but from here on out its hoofed mare or bare footed urchin
now exhibit true audacity and passively hack reason to ribbons
your excused from the roundtable admissions committee
activist legends turned hostage in fallen cities
spin me dizzy in a crosswalk
my too far gone mastodon senses inspect relentless
for fitted boogie systems with crook addictions
well sure my crown is formed of thorns
yea but my thorns are formed of sound
and i've found sounds what keep me warm
when the mornings born with frozen ground
put a rope down pull me from where the buzzards clear
the meat from the bones you and your little badass mad max musketeers
when the silhoettes of emaciated frames danced on a highwire
mistook for aspiring third world poster children
but is inserted ghost with dealin
dead to administer links like chief then whats your forte
tentacle dragger in disguise seeking the match made in your eyes
friend it don't take the wisest men in triplicate pace unified
i don't condone the blasphemy hatchery's procreation
from the floods, to the fires, to the droughts, to the cyclones
tidal waves to twisters, tornadoes, and hell stones
whirlwinds, tropical storms, blizzards and monsoons
all of which i witnessed prior to waking up inside my room
look at the crook as i panic episode tantrums
the edginess readies the mock knock quick draw hence the duel
the company of similars couldn't excite the motor
but hermit crab ace home alone-uh
one barrel of idioms and charcoal stick, courage under desire
stuck in the pluck of the harp buzzing the fuzzing televison mixer
book of saturated matches and a half-made bed
pack leader will huff cannibal fumes, mechanical zoom
said leech prior to firing up his barnacle magnet
instincts leashing himself to where the wind spitting ice storms
i'm a trace this silver lining winding round the profit chase
i know there is good in you if one peels back the opulence
but i also know its ratio to bad don't feed my confidence
the nutrients will be intense circle
the clues units of success being personal
wedged between aesop rock and a scarred face of frustrated fuck yous bound by concern
i can't believe i'm still concerned
i can't believe side children turn in their sleep over one-liners
well i yield to hear your burns
color me out of my skull draggin a wagon of creature features
and all i ever wanted was to aggravate the sleepers
crash test ideologies, catalog alien doctrines type disturbance
got em out, killing machines turn belly up
coax twenty four sevens of wide eyes from day dreamers
clean or dirty serpents in turn wish preference for the latter
justified the germ's birth cauterize the gashes after
on my left, one finger for each burrough i can touch
on my right, one finger for each time that i wake up midsummer night
who's cloaked in a pristine mantle of hellfire
but a-capital glaciers out the east slide lateral
to spawn a citizen kane of oaks out this ugly duckling seed
look i aint too attired of draggin the baggage over the seasaw seeds
when the reapers turns mortals to caspers
see the plain and stone conjurable can't mimmick the null
of a billion troops holding matchsticks to empty cannons
stand of a many moons when the sun hit the mountainside splendidly
bask in the last warmth ever known to man's tangents
in the wink of an innocent starchild's eyelid drop he vanished
managed to carve initials in the granite wall the damned it all tp
i hung with cats that do the donts
cats that forage through the moats
hoping eloping with soveriegnty and a cantine demon prodigies
i love the wake, the watch, the walk, the work
the well its almost six o'clock
i've never seen so many tugboats miss the dock
this is not your ordinary ballad
with a perfect little bow around the middle
and a black man on a white horse
or a white man on a black horse
it's got all these tired parts where
we don't even sing at random
bow around the middle
and it goes a little something like this
new walk in a broken sole , pedigree incessant
got  frame
the zealots enveloped inside the belly of the blame
cut-throats the result of pope jokes soaked in poacher constants
and now the jewel emits cold, wander prominent  honour
i bought up silkworms by the bucket like starter kits
so you first bought a stitch
nurse the tantrum with a fantasy chaser
i keep the spare wings strapped to my fuses
in case the hackers snatch the plumage
so you mean these things are worth money

oh it'll be soon
i eat ditch  in the kitchen 'til every spoon bends
looking not at hopefuls , where's the raindance
my little flint never dreamed would flood unpotable
see i sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary taste
contemporary taste made my lip drop in the first place
hmm, yo why not be a czar, analyze fallen heroics

dr-rink up, slop a goblet of dirt wine ,
i nurse a single application of introvert, serpentine
now a sunset without a scrape of red an-an-and plastic bag

and nothing terrible happened to the bag

i've got charcoals in my heart, i've got charcoals in my heart
i've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
i've got charcoals in my heart, but i've got charcoals in my heart
i've got charcoals by the armfuls that burn my armor apart
and before, when i said 'shut the fuck up, it's none of your business'
that was to be in vain
you shoulda locked that up when you're all finished

the moments were subtle but unstolen and guess who owns them
no friendly, non-threatening corporate lacky mucks in the totem
lucy was in the sky with diamonds
the summer beneath these pac-man's with acid behind his molars
little white tab hollering, little white flag waggling
inorganic pat on back, trim the panic flat on backer
back to back like mad hatter magic
splatter bachelor fabric fatter with cabbage patch lit
chemically bent-up but eager to crash for that one, two, three repeater
whose couch is this, whose house is this, who are you down with bitch?
i'm sorry, dog, i dreamt the foulest shit
there was this rabid foot talismen drowning out of my armspan
what's fouler was the other farmhands growing gills and shark fangs
what's fouler was my torso stripped to ribbons in the marshlands
let's get this window pane and shut the fuck down
down by the river where the litter sits
and lionheart critters smoke dope and act like illiterates
i ran with a brat pack of loose bolts and high social maladjusties
sacred, numb, and boundless went to same proto called cookie
well, i was dummy to some when my tongue was cradled and my skin looks crazy
spiders in the mattress, paisley sunglasses, dialated eyes green
ice grill that could burn through your picture-in-picture widescreen
poison late late show starring aes and his jigsaw face
other shit to sell from other ships that sell they dd paper
this one's for the labor days worked for rent and rolling papers

whistle while you work like a canary lung
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy to carry drugs
i sorta see it as my last flash summer
skateboards and sloppy psychedelics and big numbers
all airbrushed on a collapsible easel
and i knew the permanancy would drift

and i knew the crash and burn, how to caress it
and i knew the gash wasn't gonna stop bleeding
and i knew the ph balance wasn't right
and i knew how september would then affect it

liturgy soaked the pig lowly, spectactular delight
why, what kind of l.s.d. you like?
your lizard king has spoken
you in the back, get them up, those trails are necessarily bumped
some'll try and recapture the same flag
but i played it smart and recognized the summertime passed
is a love such as that which i exhibit for my practice
the factor which then amalgamates debates with straight-jackets and robes
huddled in brackets that blacken the average globe
xenophobe, loathe to modify the fly, feel this
i carve a notch in my wall for every stall
every fifth mark slants diagonal to symbolize your downfall
drunky peasants, honor the shifty megatron presence
slug a bolt once ceremonies of merit turn blood sport
fought in hella high seas, i freeze your mega dumb company
pumpin' out wise beads like, fly sneak-attacks on dry leaves dunce
crooked rumors turn zoomers when rookies talkin'
bad seeds blossom the wookie walk, hawkin'

my god, you think the heaven's touched the earth then
thirstin' a perch on a bursted curse
but i don't confide wine and water chose me
bored, lasso down polaris, let the glow amuse me
ok i lay me down to sleep, creepin' a slumber under red skies
heads splittin', straight sippin' a drip of dead vibes
it's red tides from here, stop and smell analog hell
clenchin' a stench of burnin' logics and a child with yearning
now someone's approached the ropes, shaking like snow-globes
others sought safety in numbers, other's flows got towed under
still another took a turn and crashed and burned while others flee
but there will never be another starvin' marvel like me
see, there's a time when  rhymin'
pain combined can't even manage to tell what the swell is, like
picture your imagery embellished with the hellish aspects of the swans
soul crafted fat cats, burrowin', left perrenial tenants discouraged in
discussin' my foresees and flourishing, uh!
poised, imploised to leak a little bit of boisture on your pride
i'm a, animated style machine in
a veening faulty production fueled by nicotine suction
from tux in my carnivore to vipers in my garden
you flash identify by the genus, species and class
buckle the architecture until it fell through
kill the survivors then raise the dead for shock value
by the time the pending settlements fully negotiated
i'll have put a sonic youth to get myself situated
it's like sadly, my style spooks juveniles like boo radley
radically weak assume the colonel kurt's in our platoon soon enough
that's one bluff call, toughens the searcher
i live for the moment of truth when big willy rapper
acknowledges failure and states "goddamn my shit is trash"
"it's time to let go", the tin man bangin' upon his chest to hear the echo
see we the people of the united, starving artistic
militia keep movin' in order to form a more perfect union
i'm cluing into the poison panoramics brewed in panic situations
it fucks a little with my brittle gift
i tell myself "stay"   up high
make a mockery of sun and moon and star til they hand over the sky
my de luxe is, fluxes, pivots to where the crux is
invade the town while village elders holler "who the fuck's this?"
see hipper cats, aggravated trudge through the muds
quickin' ones, plots thicken like, coagulated blood
rugged serpentines climb, pebble to rock
let your pretty pink cloud nine expectations please you not
proper application of the soul by my standard
candid once position from which instigations spawn
and man, i plan to die with a mic in my hand, it's like
abandon all hope yo, abandon all hope, it's like
ayo percee p, it's time to wake these kids up
word up aesop rock, they'd better take their fingers off
is you fat cats or lab rats?
trails to my steppin got em sweatin flashbacks
i played a part of minesweeper, plunking sneakers in my sunken city
defunct, and apparently examinin' famine, i'm a
volatile strobe while your blind spot swallows the globe
sing to the track and think back
when i was a boy i employed styles exhausted
by every lost child at present
normally i drill pillars of normalcy
you're cordially invited to accompany me
in rotation of the tables to label the opposition
as i choose, refusing to evolve with the cold
rapidly dissolved my involvement in a solvent of soul and roll back
brain trip the beta weights trap for the slaughter
on my call a pack or clan snaps, collapsed was the mandatory maze
on the fluids ???? and glory days
desire on the opposite circuit and glorious days
is glorious hazes of gray spun through my array of operation
and wrapped tightly in a practice with my colleagues and slackers
20,000 league nappers and the swelling increases
once the mortar hit the pestal your whole vessel fell to pieces
and i laughed, i laughed for me and my starving art family
i laughed tangibly, your failures ampin me to vamp fresh
my mic stabs white flags and drag trembling
devil skin-wearers through the terrors of compliance
once the day turns night, senoritas suck the woody like termites
and wonder how they got labeled dick-hungry damsels in distress
the all new and improved poetically portable aesop rock
available in stores with my, highly suggested parental discretion
i'm not your average man bragging, toe or hand tagging
50 grand bagging, pants sagging, trigger nigga on the bandwagon
huh, i know this nigga named rickey his girl nikki want to get with me
says "stick me just a quickie, lick me and leave a hickie"
i stick instead of tricking bread in this chickenheads
one look and said i ain't shit in bed, she must be licking lead
you'd better let your gods recognize the rhyme inspector hides
and never sweat them lies about me haters check your eyes
one verse, lung burst, as i done first
guns, slums, hearse don't stun perce, where i'm from's worse
my new cuts are hot, bodies chewed up a lot
then flew up the block to a cipher, blew up the spot
stacks of rhymes, ain't a match for mines, tracks and shine
leave you back in time in a ?beeler? still ain't at my prime
i'm a stab your face in, trial and shit is wild

my name is ian mathias bavitz
i was born in 1-9-7-6, at biosfet hospital, located in long island, ny
i am 6 foot, four i weigh 2-0-0 pounds
i have brown hair and green eyes
i enjoy writing songs, painting, movies and diner food
i have two brothers, chris and graham
in august of 2-0-0-1 i went crazy
this was originally not for public consumption
this was made for four people  four people that literally saved my life
and ahhh i mean i could live to be a thousand years old and never re-pay them
i don't think this song would pay them
but hopefully by putting it out, push the bank a little further
this ain't a burner for the whips
this ain't even aesop rock fly earthworm demeanor
my name is ian mathias bavitz and i was born in long island, new york
seventy six, before graham and after chris  ok
in august of 2001 my seemingly splinter-proof brain bone, scaffolding imploded
i kept it on the hush, but nearly tumbling
to the cold hard concrete on near bodega trips
for cigarettes and soda, shook me to casper
dizzy with a nausea chaser, motor sensory eraser
gorophobe tunnel vision, guilt, self loathing arrangements
rose rapidly out a bog i'd never fished in
that abates three separate foreign meds
while i use the hook line and sinker simple fishing
simple primitive self taught, easing of soul, mind and body
but the symptoms rejected my cave-man modus operandi
so now it's one fish belly up, through medicated mileage
shrinks that get 250 an hour for awkward silence
and, i'd be lying if i said all of this
made even the slightest fragment of sense to me
i don't know what happened, or what's still happening
i literally feel like i'm teetering on the blunt edge of my sanity
jaime, i killed the robots and i'm sorry
broke down in front of you, embarrassed
but you lent a heart and hand that only you could
you're one of my best friends and yes i'd take that bullet for you
that's my word, which is about all i have left
tony, i know you know i'm crazy, 'cause you told me
but that did never bother you, i hold you as my brother 'til death
and i got your back if ever the drunk goblin step
for makin' a cat laugh, when i was walking with the dead
katherine, mother figure, older sister, concerned be a limits
letting me know i wasn't the only one with this
continuous offers for vacation, chicago visits
talked me through repair of a head full of broken pistons
riyah, for the late night movie rentals and the company i needed
an' you knew it, but i just wouldn't admit it
you listened to me blab about my issues for hours
offer incredible advice, gave me a hug when i was finished
am i a jack of all trades? nope  i like to write songs tho'
but i could tell you that i only write shit down when i believe it
so take this how you want, but know i mean it
i want you all to know that i'm scared
out my fuckin' crooked soul and never faced a monster like the last few months
ever in my whole life  i wish i could explain this better
but the pieces won't formulate it to anything even close to cohesive
so i guess this is my feeble way to thank you
four soldiers that extended something sacred off the purity of kindness
i owe you all my life and please don't argue with that statement
'cause without y'all i may not have a life to offer, take it
i wish i could explain this better.
i'm sorry for burdening your pleasures.
i love you all with all that's left of me.
for helping try to kill what made a mess of me.
i'ma get you back someday.
just gotta figure this all out  so
i guess it is kind of funny when you look at it from a step back
how one man can literally buckle under the same pressures
i have soaked this out from all angles, walking through time
i have been over everything in my head, still i can't think anymore
but i guess some times, when you can't breathe, there are people there
i am lucky enough to have those people around me
thank you for helping me to not die
thank you for helping me to not die

run around with your face on fire
black smoke in the air.
maaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssss wins!
who you screaming at dog?
unleash the unlimited edish primitive piss
i'm singin' cynical maybe the most military ops
monkey! here's elephant, and it drops
we on a three-ringed prong ancient elephant tusk
bitter, at fully  you shruggin' it off
keep it electric, sure, but ny electra's not about electric wars
never seen a poor man's glimpse set fake
in the corner of the cave reinventing the wheel and roll out funny
sittin' on them barney rubble twenties, subtle
i could roll with the lackey's, that's if we hustle
knuckle in the mud, hell's bells in the chuckle
red-berried face means smugger round the muzzle
i'm allergic to the now-born solo panel cutters stole quo to the core
stone cold's hands out core cryogenics, stubborn
can't talk shit wit' a tongue full a' rug burn!
i'm not asking you to act like you notice
now what if in the cabin built the old pulping?
opened the mirror, stole a pulse with the voltage
keeping me alive is the vibe with the vulcan's
i break it down to the bunk for the crooks wit' the goals of a angel
structural droids; more bangs for the buck
but they want a last stegosaurs - thorns in the glove
prehistoric land shark business, cradling the arms of the car man's kidney
swarm to the sickly thawed out the glacier
beggin' for the freezer burn; back every day sir!
sir, your science loves to fuck nature
sir, your right to the dawn of my day sir
sir, your violent laugh homing beacon's never set;
who chase till we all catch vapors
don't call it a sound-off, "mars attacks" be the malarkey downfall
it's not a game no more, run from the flash, leave your penny at the door
a lot of magic gadgets; give em' all back just to nullify the savage
mic's crumble we be rockin' right; in the year of the troglodyte
saw a grey mouse rabid poured on a board to the dull morose world like a lull in a storm
and i know you was hopin' that the piece for the ox was a dull sword, ah
guess what else, i transmit from the block!
t-rex - x-ray with triple x hex
for the yesterdays, or the next i can assure you if the rza got the sword,
aint no time left.
maaaaarrrrrrrrssss wins!
your head will be down in the dirt
maaaaarrrrrrrrssss wins!
your head down with a mouth full of pebbles
that's it man, no time left.
ya'll keep talkin'. it'll get you nowhere
"you can come, i'll leap right over
i forever wallow in glitches grimly distributed by side effects
consumed, cocooned in antisocial trenches drenched!
gridled between dense pillars of polar value lies
a grey so blueless it's got eye fiendin for the sky
sittin inside solidified plastics who's latteral burns germ compatible
my firm's radically piloted, dodging a fire swiftly
i am but a prototype metroid programmed to holocaust style
while you're soakin in the stages of denial
your petty soldiers seem fragile like jaquemetti sculptures
embedded in aramatic cultures. we's rock steady vultures
plus i's the guise of rowin a soul
my wingspan stands flags in the snow of the poles
swerve my alignment towards solitary confinement and jade it
you always seem like a small grey cat to me
'til the sun came round just around noon
and you would greet me, purring in your doorway
drawing up your tail around my hips
and i would go to your mouth wide open
waitin for my nourish to come from your lips
for the love of my personal practice i reside
where obstructive fluxes and societal withdrawl collides
spun a ring around my honor
but the opulence took shelter in my horror
cast amongst the braiding of biligerence
and blazing terror that blew the lock down off my placement
i stay special agent till the sky falls
reverse the curse till my fellow lost children disperse
and your footsteps leading down the pathway
never seem to be quite like my own
it blinded me till i turned towards home
and you would watch me far in the distance
hands held high above your head
i only leave the territory where there's nothing left, to be said
"you can come, i'll leap right over"
i make music and connect color to canvas
swoop down from the trees with potpourris and other bandits
landed randomly upon the valleys of the grimace
saw my planted leaf stars burnin from the oustide in
salt prep the blades prior to five phase in my ever changin underworld
serate a day to decorate a traitor
that sting never fades like belly wounds from sling blades
follow my portion, im gonna swallow distortion and spit the filter
"you can come, i'll leap right over
let me count the holes in your foundation
ancient ridicule system alert, kissing my lurk
the perch of rare grimace on iron mask
if chemistry could silence the lions laugh i'd be fine
adrenaline trades the leaves that walk the plank
before the crimson struck a match this season
meridian carpal will jolt your logic
when the burn earned its self normalcy for 20 plus
run a muck or sink, swims not an option
slow enough for me to bask in
fast enough for me to wish it lasted
the front line of its mystique's geek
for the ogers who prefer the roller coasters
well that'll sip the blood of merry men
that'll grace holiday carols when the merry ends
barrel past the auto craft, exhale into final raft
and pirate your local rain puddle torturous
try to shake pilot fish off your dorsal fin
lets dive through the archives, synax on frantic ?
stamp it with a noteable brand to reek the profit
see i don't know hell but i've read about it often
sounds like a dope concept gone wrong
lets zoom into that war paint sensation
sayin, if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with
so make some noise for all your predecessors reppin dirty grill-age
lets deny the nervous rooms of pacin
sayin, if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with
so make some noise for all your predecessors reppin sturdy grill-age
lets remove the costume you escaped in
hold up your legacies,i'll tell you which ones my favorite
i'll teach you about the perks of patience in seminar format
i've worn that hat for seven years
that's why its discolored,ragged and shitty
i ain't about to toss when its been through all these dream wars with me
i rather starve then sit inside this gridlock till it parts
this tailor made rutiny ain't suitin me
it's tied around my neck like 13 loops rafter an apple box
heartless harvest of mine,i'm tired of pissin benediction
maybe it ain't healthy,but sometimes i rather burn then let you help me
it's getting brisk, brisk as fuck
my skin ain't thick enough ,these icicles ain't civil
how many freezer burn victims can one society on tilt manufacture
prior to hire,being intervening just to release last laughter
and every tree trunks made of third rails with tourniquet branches
and i learned to walk with an anchor in my back pocket
and man i read palms during even the most brief handshakes
and man i ain't alive to pull the weeds around the spotlit
well i'm wallowin, followin my little lost princess to the promise land
hollerin my potent slogan,hell if nostradamus can
conquering these open roads with throttle pin to floor
cause ima win right after i finish these chores
lets zoom into that war paint sensation
sayin, if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with
so make some noise for all your predecessors reppin sturdy grillage
lets deny the nervous rooms of pacin
sayin, if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with
so make some noise for all your predecessors reppin sturdy grillage
television, all hail grand pixelated god of
fuck a sore channel changed digit
i sit with a nasty network intervenes plan
with a stable diet of my cable pirate
yo, the doctor is in, the doctor is on
born the bastard son of static radiance cloned to welcome in every home
lead a blue screen, bruised dream canopy
victim of the cursed nursed technicolor drunk support team
though accused by robot news casters who capture and pollute
spoon fed hazardous fog to joy luck catholic squad
please take me, please calm me, please make me a zombie
please i want to donate my brain to the monstrous panasonic profit
dispersed to wide eyed glamour addict patients
blue be the propaganda banners, well, sure i'll be a marine
with a clean sword and blue uniform, it only takes a dollar and a dream
and i abide great idiot box power supply, fuzz vapor,
black out of new york, hey honey, get the generator
i'm in a doom, doom generation, pacin', ancient electric secret
never sleepin' to miss the am oasis
my name is a wired heart, sloppy obligation
turn my stilt into my guilt and have a chatter box blame frame adjacent station
make reality scrambled and suck the life out of a hidden vandal
and loving every minute of the gimmick, change the channel
plug it in, turn it on, prop me up against the couch
lights out, i ain't ever gonna have to leave my house
satellite dish, get up on my wish list, turn me to a tyrant
let my clean spirit dissolve through the appliance
plug it in, turn it on, be my mother when she's gone, great
wipe the spittle off my chinny-chin during the breaks
if i gotta go blind i'mma do it for the love of all television kind
make me a star, i want to touch gold
hold me suspended in a dream, merely inches from the screen
deleted passions sacrificed to one electron monster
crucify my little future to the monitor
damn it feels good, turn on, tune in
zoom in to hug the bug up in your family function
but the children seem to love it
yes mother, me and wild discovery
and heard the static flock to where i sleep
by the glow of that magic box big speaker
stereo mastered often kill the freak seekers, eyes spiraling
tangled in the star spangled wiring
i can turn from toxicated visuals
and all the kings horses abort the loyalty to royalty
riddle me with glee, hoist the end all teleprompter above my sleeping head
i'll be dead by morning anyway
color my values with mundane humor in thirty minute tickets
to feel the magnetic seal picket censorship
i want to shop from my bed and set an
example for all my overworked, underpaid brethren
i bond with a six string ? correspondence
with allegiance pledged beyond the glass surface
adamant students within the fine school of possessed graduate catalysts
it goes big screen, little screen, any screen'll do
just let me hold the controller and i won't have to murder you
plug it in, turn it on, let my little eyes glaze
twenty screens lined up along the borders of the maze
i want to see the five day forecast, fourteen days in advance
so i can get my two weeks notice every time the sun dance
plug it in, turn it on, silent fix better than nothing
let a once divine soul feel the functions of the hypnotist
the viciousness, ridiculous, peaking a dummy's interest
touch the power button meet your maker, ain't that something?
plug it in, turn it on, say goodbye to sunday afternoon
fix the antenna, sit back and let disaster bloom
it's a beautiful sight, with a most ugly intention
but i taste it everyday and bathe inside the consequences
plug it in, turn it on, never once have you talked back to me
your majesty, i love you, i despise you
my everyday is sitcom, soaps, news, bad dramatization
come along with me, my friend for the most glorious sensation

j.d. - i crawled down to the basement when the weather got cold, like a lost lamb returning to the fold, and when the outside world recedes from view, it's just a year's supply of make-up and memories of you, 1967 colt 45, holding back the vampires, keeping me alive, there's an envelope with some cash in it out by the front door, this is what they make you take the medication for
up push the daisies till the soil is stale
in a powder blue tux for the farmer's sale
mr. big sleep with the carp and kelp]
once upon a time in the days of yore
when the people lived fresh outta legend and folklore
there was an old pirate who piloted vile slang
had a bird perched on him and swash buckled the same
peg leg navigator starboard to port
by the nautical star of male an the harbor is yours
and you should tell them where you situate the gold
that is unless you'd like a vacation with davy j-j-j-jones.
like "walk the plank" for whom the shark thank
come all the shiny spoils piled higher every year
he was suffocating slow in the box of a buccaneer
ten summers prior on a night like this
crows nest scopes something afloat to the boats west
swore it blew him a kiss
when he focus seen the face of an angel upon the body of a
"what the heck!" grabbed for his telescope
shatter gathered himself she was ghost he was down the rope ladder
to deck circled the vessel the 360 swiftly
found nothing in the water but salt, piss and whiskey.
yarr, heckled by the swabbies at the bar,
he'll be the laughing stock of the barbary coast war
like this dude either got two glass eyes
or he wearing his patch on the wrong s-s-s-side
but had to prove he was raw
try to rekindle his rep via sabers and gun smoke
and battle always find him though he never told cutthroats
meanwhile, back in the now, got a brand new skeleton crew
on the move out when they aren't manning thirty burning cannons stern and bow
they are prying shiny metals out your m-m-m-mouth
okay, youth wanes old age holler wisdom and disease
like the scurvy made his yellow gums bleed.
and he was aching from his boots to the feather in his cap
till his quartermaster showed up with a stolen treasure map
one look down and lept off the dock,
see if you can guess where x marked the spot
the capital was buried at sea in a cursed cave,
only one mile from where he'd seen the mer-mer-mer-maid.
anchors up, hoist the jolly roger thank you much.
day and night with his hook hands raised and clutched
but see the vitamin deficiency was strong
so by the time they bumped into the island he could barely lift his grog
crawled off the boat, collapsed in the sand
prayers in the air, seashells in his hand
an area high tide so grand it's the one that put the one that put
the lady of the lake on dry la-la-la-land
i wish i could tell you that it ended happy
pretend like his bones weren't practically snapping
pretend like her gills didn't dry up and suffer
but that's a half-dead pirate and a fish outta water.
no lie, scout's honor, got a million more
from the burgundy lighting above the shores of whores
before your visions of grandeur go to slow those sails
remember that dead men tell no t-t-t-tales
lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barettes
city born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
the many faces of the various locals that she would meet
who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
there was mrs. crabtree, and her poodle
she always gave a wave and holler on her weekly trip down to the bingo
they'd ask her why she passed her time
now all the other children living in or near her building
ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
"hey little lucy, want to come jump double dutch?"
lucy would pause, look, grin and say
she covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk,
"lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today??"
"i'm not giving in, i'm finished," and walked away
or you can live a little dream
now lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
she traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
little bobby who would come to sweep the porch
the mailman, delivered everyday at 4
lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
but she found it suitable, and she liked it that way
rico, similar, hermit
they would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
they appreciated space and rico was an artist too
so they'd connect on saturdays to share the pictures that they drew
now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
actin nice, although she was a strange girl, really
say, "lucy, want to join me for some lunch??"
lucy would smile and say "i'm busy, thank you much"
and they would make a weird face the second the door shut
and run and tell their friends how truly crazy lucy was
and lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
'cause while they spread their rumors through the street
lucy was 87, upon her death bed
at the senior home, where she had previously checked in
traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
and she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
lucy pinned up a life worth's of pictures on the wall
and sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
no rico, he had passed, 'bout 5 years back
so the visiting hours pulled in a big flock o' nothin
she'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
"look, i've never had a dream in my life
because a dream is what you want to do, but still haven't pursued
i knew what i wanted and did it till it was done
so i've been the dream that i wanted to be since day one!"
she'd never heard lucy even talk,
she walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
then lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
raw, i'm going to give it to you
raw like that aesop rock iron-fisted list militia
while bent funny bone grown community
spit a thousand and 1 ripples to cripple the continuity
right i irrigate it straight to mainline
you want to do the same? fine
these pretty profit grommet teams solidify the clot to slippery city salt piston pump drain
but hold those incredible console with the russian roulette baboon spin-off
where everyday a thousand strangers pray for empty chambers
five sixths sweat bullets trying to keep it subtle
but i'll get you
broke inches tired of dry land
but duck skull stepping-stones suit the mix-down well
well, when the rumor spreads that y'all stupid
i didn't do it!
does it ice grill you or is every song faceless?
does it have a title? if didn't would you name it?
does it babble about nothing like a drunken atheist?
we could run that orwells '84 war
for the room 1 on 1 z-tour
till he try and fidgets with his or her own work spear specifics
see if the venom overloads this vision
i'm going to suck the poison out and spit it
stole my sneakers but your features never fit in
servers you right for trying to walk a mile outside your limits
i'm going to tiptoe across this yo-yo string
until you walk the dog out from under my feet and skip town, sit down
earth to a-r vertical burden has increased at an alarming rate
murder up, glee down and still falling
still crawling out of bed at 2 on saturdays
ease back; let a heart thump echo normalcy for 10
let the back burner boiling point descend
i race the derby in the first heat
strike personal space with the most utterly putrid version of grace
spit the gimmick, sit and fidget
while we try and jump through hoops
like coney island freak show midgets
want to be a fighter pilot
driving that childish early wright brothers experiment
sit and sweat bullets on a console
outside the most ridiculous poison tongue brain silo
dead before the chubby debutaunt conquered the high note
schooled by the cruel intention inventions pensive sideshow
i alone advance without an earthly poem
and dance on a handful of zoning fans
holding every chance to own the land i roam
truly be its only camper happy with the scrap heap
see i convinced myself it's on
therefore it is and the melody settles
beneath the fact that i'm just spitting for these kids
i tried to get them all open
and once i quit and said i didn't care
thats when they all threw their hands in the air
keep in mind this flow is used for practice.

famous last words that came back to haunt you
all your life, like permanent dried tears.

he broke the record then bowed.
said he couldn't do it without the crowd, for crying out loud.
even took the time to contaminate the rhyme scene
and drop a lot before he was out, in the common scene.

when they come to the mic, i'm 'a feel ya's.
fuck around and get your title took, cut and dry.
he doesn't lie, even like "who and where, what and why?"
hold it like a cue 'n button, button fly
once they leave the room, they be like, "doom! doom! doom!"
it's no use. blessed to design

i pointed toward the exact place my sneakers met the creedence,
said "if i could answer questions , i would be relief."
now classify don't got 'em shook by exposing the skeletons
yeah i sorta stick to a more murky-hurt development.
some of these kids are spittin just a bit too delicate a thesis.
if only  yeah, but holy jumpin jesus!
i get torn swiftly from a planet while it tilts, 23.
god made me a fine instrument of style
don't make me holy sleep bolts blindly until your mood shifts.
now here comes 40 acres of congruency pistons,

whenever i ain't spittin the gimmick.
we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies, we don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee, no, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies we just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

plus your friend said i was an asshole when he met me
no bad moves aloud when you're in the public eye
kill it; you are the weakest link goodbye
the ice is thinning in the valley of the g beats
and when the freaks come out i hug a tv
some how a channel zero benders less creepy
's bliss, repeat with a twist
when every martian in the market holler "be me"
ya learn more when your mouthpiece retreat
's bliss now listen a sip
aesop rock - the tugboat complex pt. 3
i could make 'em all dance, or i could sleep
i could walk with a limp and make your step feel incomplete
people are made of match sticks, life is but a flame
note at the craftwork door the last smirk of the the damien mainframe
my box cost siphon third rail juice from lost poets
inhabit ocean bottoms with a bitter rotten scapegoat pardons
don't bargain at martyr parliament rallies
where participants squeeze your last giggle then whittle sacrificial finalies
i can tie my new faces alone, save your knee deep offerings
sorta bring puke coughing bunk persona to light
build anti-malignant railroads, find you, and lay tracks adjacent
just to scream "fuck off" as the engine pulls out the station
what should we do with a thousand drunken sailors?
"kill 'em all, locate their family address, release a mailer"
(dear sir or madam, your son or daughter's embarrassed human kind
consuming booze and gut fuel, till they cruised across the line)
i spin gold, your raps are dirty lapsed
towards the nursery class act impression of a bubble
man huddles make us look like cool peeps and i'm trying to school sheep
towards the right idea { - 5x}
this basic divine subsidiary bust center syllable logic, fold origami
*tangled through your dream kitten, you'll probably never hear this song
let alone sip the mission long enough to listen
(i smoke cigarettes down to filter, smoke the filter down to space
now i'm gonna roll this question tight and smoke that shit up in your face
now if you were to alter masks every time fame circus approaches
do you really think your maker wouldn't notice? *think about it)
okay, i've died a thousand, and i'll die a thousand more,
i leave footprints in fours, two for bi-peds, two more to break the door
practically caress the utterings of crushed by drudgery brothers and sisters
mothering stickler cabin and madden shit
i'll fix the wing for a penny and a *parable, yeah but this friendship
sunk with a barrel full of ?? pull
i seen guys harbor bad shiners
then wonder why the culprits sitting at the their rainbows ending
with out the apple seed it's useless
patched for boredom crafts a castle out of toothpicks
i breath to hard nearly metamorph castle loose pins
now i stand to breath as not to disturb the*plummage
and i know that's not a story, it no longer turns my stomach
hollering wolves in the form of one frustrated culprit
but a love tap full of washed up stardom melted trying to milk it
win a ticket to right white lines highway sideways melt it smelt it
one love to the rungs in my ladder, one love to the gathering of
laughter bats that hung from my rafters
see the jackal met the badger, they were both such fucking bad asses
that clashing wouldn't make sense
now i ain't gonna name name's, and i ain't gonna drag others in
but i ain't about to say that i'm the only cat you got bubbling
your lucky, somehow you managed to befriend some good people
who will sit and soak the evils you secrete, but why? i'm not really sure
(knock the fuck off, kicking his lip across the floor
'til the archival vinyl venom soak the lure
fusing a million majesty murders then stole the crown)
oh wait that's right, you discovered me right?
offered up the peace pipe, and oh
it's all cotton candy when aesop rock the b line
he's actin foolish left in the middle of laying bricks
oh and for the record i've been rhyming since me and andre thought we could freestyle
built foundation out of passion and brother dusty tasking
studied dope rappers, vocab expansion, poems and syllable placement
your just mad 'cause somewhere in there you came and went
dismissed it as casually non compatible and bounced
obtained status where i could straight objectively critique your after projects like
or (damn that shit is garbage, what happened?
yeah, but the barriers were broken
you made comments to the wrong ?? who out of respect and honor leaked your program
now like were both trying to sit and breath another dawn so my advice
to you is when i say just "move on" { - 5x}
i spell 666 star six nine click
give his telephone a viking funeral, bye bitch
treble hook two birds, cheap thrills, free meal
vacate jellystone park with your brie wheel
half his life was likely to be nikes on the l-train
gnawin' on his dog toy, pocket full of deer blood
the only thing that's stoppin' him was dokken in his earbuds
found everything he loved crushed down to a cube
the new kowloon chowline, two leads routing medicine and gruel
one is hemorrhaging money, the other jettisoning fuel
but it wasn't ever neighborhood-degenerate approved
bolts on his neck, one tubesock wonky
16-panel head mutton chop and ambulax
double pits to chesty got the espy on a camel's back
handle that huffy wit' a timely parry
and get all up in your kitchen, money, guy fieri
there is a wildly elusive moment of bliss
in the spaces between being told you are shit
i would openly suggest identifying the closest
and collectivly agreeing to meet if the sky opens
i'd like to speak to a supervisor
back alley brawl over party guests who want a
steak tartare but we're hardly pet food
you're gonna need a bigger boat and a holy diver
aggravated people driving lemons over limits
with a neck bop stemming and a cartoon physics
smart move taught never broadcast holes in his armor
handcuffed down to a toothless tease
who got an x-marked mouth and a hooch machine
with eyes that tell the story of the woods that fetter
and a chest that sells the ending when it's pushed together
been through the desert on a horse that's nameless
now i'm driving through the city in the porsche naked
shores invaded by the new marines
that tear the roof off this mother like buford t
untrained pet with a pen name
chest pain, bet he outlive his own endgame, anyway
step around the rhythm of the red rain
getaway car horn, stand by, tenth frame
spare me the dramatics to ratchets, smile purdy
flashlight strapped to the calf of a wild turkey
package of mild jerky, captain to aisle 30
there's a man with a mask an an app that can dial fergie
i'd like to speak to a supervisor
get a couple or more to carry you to the burial
fresh to death and keep it def to the left
well it was capricorn, virgo, aquarius
, pisces, libra, scorpio, aries, gemini, taurus
delicate freak show alert the frame
bash all flags where the mag spin park
corroded by the volts that jolt the cold vein
boogie down kits to slip past the guard
def with a mascot of radical mass
megaphone fuzz and a woofer on fritz
we are not trained to divert the crash
but march face first with a prayer for the blitz
stand up for the cinema fire, simian ire
cold shimmy for the cinnamon sky;
intimate eyes loop all known alleys
scoop the bounty like daddy hires bazooka to murder ralphie
i curdle with burnt milk, pariah sigh, honor piranha money
count it with the knuckle that hustle bread out a copper tummy
one of these rebels could level the marked city
but the n.y. uber alles governor's picky
i'll be the jenky jesus for the species you bleed with
jump guns through the ninth gate
jump guns like a noon six burner lit up on the ninth pace
even set among a portion conformed to the blind stage
never lured by the formal watching imported wines age
we bow to the gusto mustered by the mecha-bot
plowed by the public, ushered out the letterbox
wowed by the subject punctured by the helicop
the widescreen version
these area a few of my favorite venomous side effects
mamba, water moc, pit viper, diamond back
anaconda, boomslang, cobra, bite 'em back
spinal tap crabs to the clapper
aesop rock is the cadillac of natural disaster
that's why the envelope is where it wasn't
i work with the builders, whittle my gorilla military
and fizzle 'em through the vigilante filters
who lamps left of the toggle?
how'd they fit that ninja in a bottle?
a hundred million motherfuckers with they hands out
verse a walking zipper bomb trying to keep the man down
it's either fancy footwork or get bit by the hounds
it's either fist to the sky or get bit by the crowd
well it was capricorn, virgo, aquarius
, pisces, libra, scorpio, aries, gemini, taurus
i was chewing my tongue out of my mouth one day
when the blood in my beard hit the dirt by the blazers
would have said 'curb it' like any nervous habit
'til maverick told me the coyote pack could smell the wound for acres
and labor to cater fang to fisherman gut critters
oblivious to the glimmer of innocent duck feathers
i'll be at the bronx zoo with a lock pick kit
on the eject for cockpit bench, helicop clip
nazi cops on kamikaze belly flop shit
we are the tired and poor, we come for your water
when the mayor knuckle dust city worker bugs
when the stars finger babies like i flirt with sluts
you'll see the fire engine red fox ears perk up
metal kettle unsettling treble howl, settler trembling
measuring mellow on the levitate off the mezzanine
never seen a ton of bricks dressing clean dapper
'til it's pin stripe and skull chunk forty stories after
and u.s.a. on a ketamine disaster
crack if the former left you unimpressed
now pardon me if part of me heart of an oddball, but damn
terminally alienated and bent awkward by the bought
prepped package of the slickest spin-doctors
raised where the paranoid hide tools proper
like suspicious cargo in a high school locker
and it looks like war, quacks like war
so it's occam's razor and i'm swayze out the door
a hundred million motherfuckers hold me back
the hand cannons won't ask 'bout your zodiac, boy
oh, i never said. the blood analysis came back from the lab - most of
it was from a lion, but some of it was from a bat.
hey, what's up dude, want a sun chip?!
fuck you, hail mary mallon! fuck you!
bucket-seater theater sucks, i duck and weave
riddle of the pixelated ticker taking prisoners and a number please
aes, i twidddle thumbs with underlings
drugs
barrel in escorted by a chorus line of bedbugs
low-tech dreck from his neck of the cement woods
we come in pieces under siege and unwilling
kicking and screaming, creatures summoned to the feet of the city
as the parking ticketed guilty, beetlejuice in the waiting room
ogling this bird who put the double d in 'day of doom'
and you can see a sitting duck grow up into a baying wolf
like a decade in a glass box yelling shook her feathers
utter "unto thee i surrender mine flesh!"
she said "put the yellow sticker on your fender - next!"
raging bull mad truck never bagging the rain kill
curse of the slango feather take it and late rope
double jack drink, 6 minutes till gate close

brain exterminated through the whiskers
we usher in the salts that call the husk home
might embalm and stiffen and rid the fawn of all his liquids
slather it in beeswax, wrap it up in ribbons
like limb by limb, by tail by ear by chin

i hope you vow to meow another day and never
decompose, by the way before we seal these molds

i feel that mystifying times have gotten ugly
i also feel that you could learn a lot from a mummy

all these tribes hoard breads and wines
these climates transform men to swine
all these hives hide knives and lead
these bribes can't transform swine to men
like shovels above a butter lamb with peppercorn eyes
sick people pinky swearing on concealed 6th fingers
that's idle handwork in the spirit of death dealers
flourish in the blind spot of spittle county gore police
or really any readily ebbing and flowing war and peace
1 plain brown key foods bag head
2 holes later i'll see to this loose flatbread
cats fucked off, at exactly what cost
the currency of brotherhood back in his cut palm
it sucks, it's nauseating dawn crawling with bugs
they seem attracted to the matters ofthe morally snubbed
see my goodnight irene' massacred flat in the key of tragedy
whole diner like "i'll have he's having"
all these tribes hoard breads and wines
these climates transform men to swine
all these hives hide knives and lead
these bribes can't transform swine to men
today a thousand sea lions got up and left a pier
they had successfully invaded and secured for 20 years
some said it was the food supply or shifting weather patterns
truthfully a whole community of scientists are in maybe 10 showed up at the wharf
as if guided by the trident of poseidon to cavort
each a lumbering and boisterous glutton
like a half-ton annoyance til the heart-warming story went public
you'll need a montage, animals arriving in droves
a bottom dollar turns a nuisance to the pride of your cove
which bring us back up to this morning when the colony dove
i got a couple unsubstantiated thoughts of my own they go
maybe it'd feel more majestic and less fatty
if a 12 year old wasn't beaning it with salt water taffy
every 5 fucking seconds, sounds like your basic
liberating moment of collective "fuck fame" shit
all these tribes hoard breads and wines
these climates transform men to swine
all these hives hide knives and lead
these bribes can't transform swine to men
greasy grimy gopher guts;explain poolside; 0 for 1 and don't forget spoons twice
lukewarm folgers; mold on his moonpie
rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
my duty go from moving in packs to sharing food with a cat.  "it's me, i accidentally sawed a woman in half."
she said "i'll keep you in my prayers," i said "i need to hide a body," she said "ok honey, talk to you on friday."
apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter. according to the blood-and-water chapter. weird
who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway? probably some surly dad; only child, 30 cats. looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past. except it doesn't always work like that
today i pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt; where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn; i told them "you will grow to be something inventive and electric; you are healthy, you are special, you are present." then i let them go
you were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
i was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
simian or lizard?
as it were there is a disappearing difference
antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
move as a godless heathen; black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'yukon cornelius'
i'm a that's better, here we here we go. disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized, contraband keeping the core of his hyde jekyll-ized
check! nevermind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
it is something he must handle on his own; the wind blown way, wanna win? don't play
today i pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark where the grape vines climb a convenient barn; i told them "you will grow to be something tenacious and exalted; you are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded." then i let them go
i have been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
i have been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
i have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed me on the temple
i have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wish it's history disassembled
i have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
i have been unfairly resentful of those i wish that acted different when the bidding was essential
i have been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
i have been my own worse enemy since the very genesis of rebels
today i pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand, where the low tide showcased a promised land. i told them "you will grow to be something dynamic and impressive; you are patient you are gallant you are festive."

and melt bootleg g.i. joes to black taffy
fold wildlife out of wolf pack wrapping
full moon, bad knee, wool hat, caffeine

locate and aim for the token propane tank
bang! followed from a pulling of hair
to a homecoming sullied by a skull on a spear
it spun a human resources issue to public affair
reciprocity is a pestilent compulsion to bear
and ultimately unfulfilling, concurrently that rigid upper lipping grudge or crippling

outside what our fundamental sciences teach,
the man-ape translates glam thru the visor
blinker like a hallowed bonfire over samhain
span where the praying hands mandate
bars an extension of the arms
they're mutating instead of being farmed
haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us
going ford, jag, datsun, corvette, lotus
all cones you can slalom when your focused

who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring
and still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank charlie

hm, late after your cinderella pulsate and crash i was rotating casts
picture if you will a witching hour on week night in the trenches
where paranoia dead-ends in a bright florescent heaven
keep the funnel cake i'm honey glaze in vitro

with a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
show up around 1 never get your god back
if you're just tuning in, walk into the light
i boil oil too, not for scarfing
for ccs of japanese innovation that screech into free parking
purple heart and 2nd chin that beseech him to squeeze the carbs into the motherboard
you can chew the eucharist in cruller form
locally a seedy danish underworld is bustling where jelly's not a celebrated it's a puppet string
5 cow stomachs like a mime with a rope going nowhere
fast, right hand of god on my shoulder, crows feet swollen, dopey
combing apple fritters over with folk of opposing cultures
baby sitter cop thief reverend, body glitter, botched c-section, bronze teeth
yet if threatened will defend the rasin bread as codefendants
some lose religion or view it as superstition
you can tell a friend ifyou are down to kill them
shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
with a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
show up around 1 never get your god back
if you're just tuning in, walk into the light
the fat boys are back, foam fingers over open arms
to feverishly reclaim their stomachs from golden jars
and stagger through the pulse ofthe gulch on a builder's dividends
hiding high behind his guilty powdered-sugar fingerprints
seething eventide fever, sidewalk feeling a little dicey
i'm snake-eye straight to the cakes icing
might, fortune-teller up your favorite paper tiger stripe
great, grace invaders, the first-name basis patron haters
who compromise the pilot lights and flavors
silent night, holy night, invite the pious out the pagan
midnight kitchen doors un-caging the enablers like butchers in bloody aprons
can i get a fucking amen?
amen, hazelnut raiders of the lost,
navigate consecutive pastries like stations of the cross
know the folk where it virgin mary toast by the loaf
shh, every night at 12 they would march out from the back
with a tray of raw dough for the pool of hot fat
show up around 1 never get your god back
if you're just tuning in, walk into the light

smoke out moles like a force of nature
pray fortune return to his favor
maybe in the form of a nest egg
maybe in the form of a tesla death ray
or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict
i mean, i guess it matters to me
i wish it mattered to you
kick the same bucket like chinatown turtles
roving packs of elusive young become

spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles

cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
around folk backed into what they most lampoon
shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
but i spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling
roving packs of elusive young become
choke lore writers over boosted drums
in the terrifying face of a future tongue

july 4th 1981,candles of a roman ilk
into the home her folks had built
patio was charcoals and extended fam in folding chairs
safely arced around the yard to focus on the smoking flares
couple cousins, uncles, aunts, mostly grown-ups, couple brats
she's too close to the jumping jacks
mommy scoops her to the house
rolls her to the storm door
let her long for all the lunacy
she's off into the sour patch
past the pyrotechnics undetected and invisible
woke the sleeping beagle skipping toward the kidney swimming pool
ruby's lungs were filling by the time her kin were cognizant
the beast she had earlier stirred had been alert since waking up
howling guests assumed the cloven hoofs had come to do-si-do
part to let the elders see
soggy beagle gently dragging ruby in his yellow teeth
laid the tiny body in the sun before her fathers feet
when she choked the liquid through her bluish lips he dropped his knee
somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
composed himself to artfully carve zoso in his desk
they was probably thinking fuck you fuck you fuck you in they head
with a hell bound arm and a acidy wash
and a pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
like a badge of mystique that technically sucked
taking the name of the father in vain
on the way to the blade in his locker, it's strange
a switch he lifted from a siblings skippy jar
who branched off into ninja stars
and never knew his shit was sharp
to here with a higher purpose
and a prime alert to juvenile beserkers
like kush van morrison an arcade drop floor
down to the valley time for miss ahkmar, watch
capital z, slowly maneuver the o
s is the most difficult to control
into the eye of goliath you goes
will pull the monkey up right
the class was making them develop backwards
it would appear you spelled out all the answers
somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust,
composed themselves enough to magic-marker zulu on these chucks,
they was tryin to do the buckle font from renegades of funk,
in a 3d frame of exploding brick, and whiz-lines for the locally motion sick,
beyond gross but evoked a host of oh dip where a social neurosis owned the whole strip, heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth in the marrow of waiting his guardians out, flashlight, chisel tips, milked venom, pistol grip, images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick, silent agreement at hand, king of the hill for a queen of the damned, she in the doorway seething began that clean white pair had a 3-year planl, oops, capital zed, radical u in the cut, truly to beautiful l"oser it up, and he done, collateral damage a future alum, that key to shambala, planet rocking, bambaatta, sample chop, churning out a cancer for the vandal squad, analog, and he finds, animated colors on a page, like synthesized cultures on a stage
somebody in a cultivated moment of resolve,
composed themselves enough to publicize "the zeros in this stall,
they was scoping every dog and pony previously scrawled,
with a festering hate for the gum drop edge, disco sucks tee,
punks not dead, but a transient teen unsung godsend, via 3 bar chords and a mugshot grin, cheese, sign of a runaway tone in the face of authority thumbing nose, cutting its teeth,
pretzled up in special order vinyl,
and birds that dip their belts in little metal porcupine quills,
2 dutch at a show in the front,
low-key to the can for a smoke and a fuck, trixie,
fixing her lipstick up, when his mitts got bit by the mischief bug,
snatchl, capital zed, terrible e in vermillion red,
gimme an 0 and a slippery s, over a web of the shittiest bands,
that beat your heart out, never bleeped your favorite parts out from a learned curve, of bird fingers bursting out of germs burns, urgently,
offered through the circuits ofan earlier plot, ill see you at the
when they ask how you, feeling you, tell em you,
feeling like, something important died screaming, you, tell em you, feeling like, something even more important arrived breathing,
something you should probably try feeding,
when they as how you, living you, tell em you, living like,
something important died hissing, you, tell em you,
living like, something even more important arrived giving,
something you should probably try willing
postcards from the pink bath leisure as a cloaked horse
through a stained-glass saint peter, hack faith-healer
cheat death to the very end, cherry wooden nickels on his specs for the ferryman
for the supper when a punk goes out
and encased where the claw marks wane off broadway the god way
commuters from the farms with news of el chupacabra
who transfuse soup out a fresh punk skull
said a pall bore not a sure sign ofjarred lightning"
harsh, that's how the yellow spine-diner was born
feral feeding that strung his organs up like tire swing art
chippin' a drippy set of broke bone grinders
less for the land mine finders
fine, no defacto leaders in the eatery
unless you count the way they led his heart through his tuxedo tee
chew together when a punk goes out
run a culinary school for gluttony-drunk wolves
early sign of punk showed up on the diagnostic
hm, pardon if i seem stand all the see-sawed loss, i can't call it
all petite drawn straws and orange caution
or outcast creeps re-involved for absolvement
it's gaudy, plus when a hell-bound offspring and yours share an all evolve salty
watch, if fortune is a bitch with venom and laser tits
maybe sin ll make for sugar-flavored flesh
kings taste terrible at best and rest in peace raw
black feather stick together forever and ever and they always remember you
and all of the shit you do
they pass it to the baby birdies and then they remember too
little baby bluebird eyes turn black
without forgetting the face of the guy in the mask
when you see me baby will you scream or will you laugh?
little baby blue bird, eyes turn black
4 and 20 gory pantone black crows shredding innards
the silouettes are fencing lefty scissors
separating horn and hoof as own arpeggiators
they piggy back the tombs of all your deadest friends and neighbors
by the getty image, green-cheese moon
shifter shit, brother was a face card
crown like a heart-shaped tunnel of woven branches leaning in over his hydro-plaining pace car chase
wait up let me isolate the bass more
aim to rake the snow off each forsaken name here
supposedly closure'l free the vipers out the bosom
personally i think it's a bunch of bullshit
god forbid he flip the witch against her coven on some dip or play the dozens
now i baptize skips in larvae and dental records
on a little plot pregnant with 6 million sentenceenders
and the tech support for tragedy's emphatically horrendous
teenage operators explaining what bated breath is
pass, i wish it were something i could diagram on a napkin so you won't feel so detached if it should happen to you privately
publicly your shadows'll cat call back
happy to split the button eye and burlap doll
bats eject like cousin death's wing-ed iapdogs ricocheting sonar of the sacrilege
now let me slow this whole shit down for all you half-goat cowards
i'll even grit my teeth for you
i am so completely off the god-damn grid it's not a question of addressing me, i
t's "what do these symbols under the dresser mean"
perhaps a little dash of karma chameleons through the entropy for good/young
still, proximity to corpses wasn't nothing to the kid but unforgiving science or cinematic horrors
fast forward, my knee in the gut of a glass
"remember that cow in the dean's seems awkward
and i know your people donated pints to the same pavement but for ash and bone to share a space with strangers seems outrageous, ain't it?
maybe a dialog of howls that reshapes thejowls and face somehow relates to whatever you have found among a thousand cloned shrines, either way - dope stone lion
and they call to let you know your friend is dead in a box
the crows have the tools to get the meat out of the box
scientific, ritualistic, headstone cold foxes still rot
i'm not gonna rot, no, fuck that snot
you can let them let you rot, man
but i'm not going to watch
i'm not gonna stand atop your plot
i love you friends, but i'm just not
on the other hand if your ashes are scattered in the sea
i will swim in the sea and you'll be with me
and if your shit is scattered at the roots of a tree
everything you think you're hiding shows
in the way you view the graves like a string of tiny thrones
messages you'd tucked away for keeps has resurfaced to be heard amidst the butchery and beaks
you don't want the passengers to pass
you want each cow taxidermy'd fatter than the last
while it might enhance a silhouette it might expose a crutch
a proud chest puffed to the heavens
holds nothing if we're cutting past the muscle and the tendon
and we will be cutting past the muscle and the tendon
ian why don't you say grace
"dear god thanks, and if you loved me vegetables would be extinct"
now i'm looking down the barrel of a string-bean side like an exodus of biblical proportion redefined
rectangle seat 4, squeeze 5, each one
may not be excused from the table til the green gone
stomach revvin up an episodic rerun
where's a dissipating plume of smoke when you need one?
chris and graham hate em too but advocate a braver chew invented for the code red, cola chaser, nose held, gulp!
moments later 2 have been released
leaving me the legroom and the legume police

defies the glory ofthe poultry or fish
via communal bloodletting that rupture spud levy
no '87 supper-scape was truly flood-friendly, ever
including at your basic cemetery for contaminated textures 60 minutes into never
where room temp heirlooms emanate a crude black mist
to a rendition of "dude, dad's pissed"
not to mention genuinely brandishing a the new gill hue
still out-mule any last strafing watchmen

fat neck, fine tooth, rock and lean, yelling
"this ends now eat the god damn beans!" ah!
hangdog mouth talk slang wrong and that there's flatware exhumed by a crane arm
stab one ripe for a swipe and extraction
carried to the cavernous yap and obliged access

pointer finger plug a hole in the damn

a lot of funny shit happened to him
my other brother pretty funny too
ain't seen him in a minute though
just in case of rough waters, i wanna put one up for my brothers
just in case of rough waters, i wanna put one up for my brothers
not a part of the machine
neubaten tee, plaid flannel laden adolescent art kid
tony hawk hair, skinny puppy denim
and a record player vomiting alien sex fiend
peel sessions in a christian home for field testing
it's real youth in the palm of your hand
when your mom thinks satan is involved in a band
we were buried in the village voice
pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear
five words, like a beacon of light in the mist
it was christ has risen to chris
miracle of mechanized loops on 2-inch
coming to a theatre he would be there in the flesh
moms didn't say "no," but she didn't say "yes"
copped tickets, ha the plot thickens
"why are they called ministry? are they a cult?"
bought a mag with an al jourgensen interview
read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three
simply, "you will not be going to the show and that's final!"
what occurred next were the top of the lungs of a son who unjustly had lost what he'd loved
in a moment that would transcend anger to high-arts
said, "this is something i am willing to die for!"
can you even imagine a death in the fam from industrial fandom?
anyway, no body count no concert and chris kicked rocks in his mismatched converse
my older brother is a funny dude
a lot of funny shit happened to him
we hadn't spoken in a couple moons
just in case of rough waters, i wanna put one up for my brothers
just in case of rough waters, i wanna put one up for my brothers
just in case of rough waters, i wanna put one up for my brothers
if i died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
i used to floss the albatross like daddy kane with the chain
i'm tryin' to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
the kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
deep in a self imposed stockholm and lima influx
maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
made any mingling akin to bein' seasoned and stuffed
it's a theatre of jumpin' jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
miserable and flimsy from the skivvys to the pissy pants
they're sketching with da vinci's hands
delusion turn a communication of prison camp
you fuckin' dorks ain't a threat to the cause
there ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
i think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
step out the tempest to measure of what the spectrum involves
maybe no one cares, party over here, i'll be over there
don't need no help, all by myself
i used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
it meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
i know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
i think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
the songs are echolocation up in impregnable fog
that's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
and a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
i ain't even mad, i'm impressed, shit it's baffling
god almighty chop an ivory tower to piano keys
play your own dirge on the way to surfin' maggot beach
you fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art
you can't be cooler than the corners where you source all your parts the poker face, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
we let the manticore out, we make the sorcery bark
life is so unfair, party over here, i'll be over there
don't need no help, all by myself
i view the rattling of sabres like a show to expose
with braggadocio to go from mostly jokey to gross
corrode a homie til his probity is notably ghost
before the hobby was a job he was a manager,
hell you would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
the disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
that you was anything menacing is a difficult sell
in a whistle-and-bellorama, black mollies to dress up like piranha
it's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga
i'm very voluntarily persona non grata
you fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need
this ain't the medium for divas out to weasel and breed
i'm off in coffee with the paupers over tea with the queen
don't make 'em show the regency what disobedient means
heavy load to bear, party over here, i'll be over there
don't need no help, all by myself
my spirit animal comes with a pretzel bun
troll of a treadmill, record on the kessel run
techies with the treble down, this is how we level up
dead meat, time travel, pressure, and disease
as ushered out of two fingers pecking at the keys
the coping mechanism in his lmnops
went from healthy to unhealthy to oh hell he never leaves
cineplex jesus, curse at the curly fries
mulling over chuck d telling me diversify
i'm at the supercut souping up the wardrobe
fourcast looking like ganesh on four phones
bass in your facefuck, brace for the rain dance
after a magical nap in a vacuum
before climbing douchebag mountain i was skate or die
started eating kale and came to terms with my lazy eye
puttin on the yoga lady, cuttin off the cable guy
whistle while you're waiting for your condition to stabilize
a/v cables everywhere, every piece of vinyl scratched
mentholated tiger balm, aleve with the arthritis cap
irons in the niacin, iron quiet riot masked
unabashed privacy expanding in a simulcast
forty winks never the same adventure
refreshing or this ain't the longest exorcism ever
in the end you gotta wonder if its even worth the effort
no stairways into heaven, you can step into the escher
some people have mistaken my allegience for a weakness
they fucked me up for eons, i wish there wes a theist
the type to fake his death and forget he faked his death
show up on tv in the crowd at the avns
sometimes i feel my heart putrifying inside my body
from diary at dark, to piety in the ponzi
on my better days they mingle and walk off into the poppy
on my worst, work is overshadowed by the monte
i had to buy some clothes that fit me and pretend i like agave
with a promise to his congress not to compromise the motley
maybe i should kinda sorta move to mars
i'm feeling kinda done, too many moving parts
the piss-poor vision is forty percent floaters
the kitchen is a chorus of glorious leftovers
the friends you confessed all the dark shit to
would weaponize the information before we can send roses
and they want a little pearl and how we got to where we at
i can't remember where i am, i feel it's probably a trap
balk with the lawless, cough in his notes
walk on even when the walls hug his coat
hard to admit that i used to draw
doodle of a two headed unicorn, it was soothing
moving his arm in a fusion of man mad tools
even if it went beautifully wrong
it was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
oozed in a brand new cuneiform
got a whole gray scale ungluing his world
might zone out to the yap of the magpie
cross contour little bit of back light
black ink after a bristol to baptize
you can imagine the rush that ensue
when you get 3 dimensions stuffed into 2
then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
being trained and observed by a capable few
back in new york, 5 peeps and a dog
in a 2 bedroom doing menial jobs
plus, rhyming and stealing and being a clod
i left some years a deer in the light
i left some will to spirit away
haunted by the thought of what i should have been continuing a mission that was routed in a 20 year affinity in rickety condition with an id crisis
nap on the front lawn, look up at the sky its
shapes falling out of the fringe
all heart though we would've made cowardly kinds
they will chop you down just to count your rings
just to count your rings, just to count your rings
colors pouring out of the fringe
all heart though we would've made cowardly kings
they will chop you down just to count your rings
just to count your rings, just to count your rings
hard to admit that i used to paint
natural light on the human face
stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
book like a tattooed pigskin, look
drank kool aid from a tube of acrylic
and i grew up linseed oil over linen
joy to the poison, voice in the resin
capture a map of the gesture
back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
zinc white lightening shoots from his fingers
studios drone with allusions of tinctures
stay tuned for the spooky adventures
you can imagine the stars that align
when a forearm starts foreshortening right
or a torso hung on a warping spine
and proportion reads as warm and alive
routine day with a dirt cheap brush
then a week goes by and it goes untouched
then the rest of your life you beat yourself up
i left some seasons eager to fall
i left some work to bury alive
i let my means of being dissolve
i let my person curl up and die
eating up his innards in unfeasible anxiety is brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy aligning with the trials of the anti-midas
nap on the back lawn look up at the sky its
shapes falling out of the fringe
all heart though we would've made cowardly kinds
they will chop you down just to count your rings
just to count your rings, just to count your rings
colors pouring out of the fringe
all heart though we would've made cowardly kings
they will chop you down just to count your rings
just to count your rings, just to count your rings
at night i wear a wolf's head on my regular head
food hoarder, communes with the flora
computes in cahoots with beauty and brute force
i've got a brand new normal at a thirty in new york, plus
years at the fire pulling portions out of corn husks
never mind time on the short bus
terrifying errant knights thwarting any motherfucking fork tongued-sport
agita flashing the hind molars, though his body less a weapon more a bag of lipomas
over medium, treat skin-tags like scratch-offs
rap like black-ops, rappers like lap dogs
he got the rad moves, catty alpha rat-proof
twenty-sided die at the crap-shoot
looking for a black hole to casually collapse through
try isle nine by the cat food
ooh wee, do we roast in a bilge, when the skinny from afar is darigold in them hills
time better let a couple truths decay, if somebody going to rue the day
i put a pebble on a tomb
the whip got a tongue and teeth
too tough, two blood-shot eyes with a tungston bleep
when any putrefying arrow wants your lungs in reach
i field a vessel going zero to the fuck y'all think
and when your function fails i'm on an undisclosed island
stroking exotic animals, open up rocket science
leaning a jewellers loupe over a stolen sock 'o diamonds
palm-made products a portrait of modern triumph, try us
back at the battering ram post-haste
cro-mags, wait till this saturday plant grow legs
all you hear is intimate and code names
ricochet around the geometry of a closed space
unfrozen part of his new day-o
face of divine evil, heart of camu tao
some people find the daylight to be oddly alluring
i was in the dark, dodging and burning
maybe cause i look like an ugly doll
pack a wallop in the wheelhouse
all hog to we know costume
black hoodie you can set your watch to
tall drink, depths like an air raid
radically detach with purveyors of the hair-brain
down with the ship go a dozen fried wild links
get pie-faced, sent home tied to the sinewaves
riding down the block, scooping bobby in a boogie-down
30 noodle-town"
cool 'em down, global domination over sold bake
situation commanding a broke dude cosplay
you don't want a meeting on an off-day trading horror stories from the hollows
"these hate those and this thinks that's absurd"
yip yap, y'all cats and birds
